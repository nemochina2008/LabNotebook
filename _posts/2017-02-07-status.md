## What have I worked on?
 
* `popBuffering`: submitted after some final tweaking.

* `priorityEffects2`: Alyssa said data would be updated and validated by end of week or early next week. I have the best support. No more being in the lab at midnight because of stupid _Daphnia_ during my dissertation. 

* `checkerboard`: last week of first gen of checkerboard. Made new datasheets. Worked on some model dev last week/weekend, but should probably push this further along soon. 

* `rangeShape`: Alan got back to me with comments, so I'm working his comments in and sprucing this work in general. I let it sit on the backburner once beetle projects produced data. Finished my edits. Passing to Robin to get her feedback. 

* `priorityEffects1`: some small ms tweaking. Supplemental materials dev. 

* `dispersalTrait`: not seeing much dispersal. Perhaps just a slow day. Perhaps the effect of density or paint? ugh.




### Tonight 

* `arc`: run run run

* `graphDissim`: check on status of dist calculation 

* `helmSize`: push forward manuscript text. 




## What should I be working on now? 

* `checkerboard`: model dev

* `priorityEffects1`: ms dev and tweaks

* `priorityEffects2`: skeleton writing

* `dispersalTrait`: keep an eye on. If dispersal isn't high enough, we can't estimate it well. We may have to change experimental design.
