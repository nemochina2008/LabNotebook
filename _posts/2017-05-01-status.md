## What have I worked on?
 
This is over the past week or so that I haven't updated this page. 

* `missingLinks`: finalized response to reviewers and sent back in. Fingers crossed. Code also prettied up (better documentation and some stylistic changes) and prepped for distribution on figshare. 
  
* `popBuffering`: responses to reviewers and sent to John for edits. 

* `priorityEffects`: found small bug in two-species code that shifted some of the numbers and plots, but not the overall findings. Updated. 

* `checkerboard1`: manuscript dev and final plotting.

* `dispersalTrait`: manuscript dev and final plotting.

* `flatEarth`: incorporated Alan's suggestions and read over it one final time. Sent to John for his approval before submission. 

* `nodeProperties`: looked over and incorporated comments from Barbara. Sent to Charlie for a final round of comments. Code made to look less ugly and more clear (trimmed fat, fixed style issues, etc.)

* `hostRange`: Shan and Charlie have signed off on revisions/responses. Andrew and John haven't yet. 

* `rangeLean`: Data + model integration. Hit another issue with model. 





### Tonight 

* `dispersalTrait`: make competition heatmap and add in to supplement. Pass this and `checkerboard1` to Brett and Alan on Wednesday. 

* `pack`: Brother's wedding is soon. Need to pack and such. 







## What should I be working on now? 


* `KeesingTalk`: Felicia Keesing is giving a talk, and there's an associated poster session (?). I'm going to meet a bunch of disease ecologists, which will be lovely since I've only interacted with population and community ecologists for the past 8 months. 

* `macroHelminth`: needs some TLC. 

* `microcosmReview`: push along my section 

* `rangeLean`: data + model integration
 
* `centConserve` or `dietBreadth` if you have free time.
