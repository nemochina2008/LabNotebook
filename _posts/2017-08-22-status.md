## What have I worked on?

* `PEARL`: provided comments on manuscript

* `rangeLean`: checked out Robin's edits to the numerics. Things are looking solid. Made some minor edits. Sat down and thought about plotting and next steps. 

* `thresholdDensity`: Marty gave approval. Final text edits and polishing. Submitted the manuscript. Fingers crossed.




### Tonight 

* `run`: 3-4 x 2000m, 2 min rest, may try to do more depending on pace and how much garbage it feels like. 

* `spatExtinct`: sims and T~e~ raster output

* `rangeLean`: run some sims tonight if time permits



## What should I be working on now? 

* `rangeLean`: continue pushing along. 

* `helminthR`: submit to CRAN (been dragging my heels on this one with minor tweaks to docs, etc.)

* `missingLinks2`: code dev. Send to Drew to run on high memory machine whenever it's ready. Check imputation to make sure nothing hinky is going on. 

* `reading`: read some stuff
