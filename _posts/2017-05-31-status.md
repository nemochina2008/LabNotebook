## What have I worked on?
 
* `thresholdDensity`: incorporating Frank's comments. Pretty extensive, but really solid. 
 
* `labMeeting`: discussed microcosm work

* `parasiteExtinction`: provided tiny comments on re-submission

* `rangeLean`: worked on a bit of plotting and manuscript structure last night. Including it here, because spent some of the day thinking about the next steps with respect to manuscript structure and model integration. 

* `WOSfail`: took some time to put pen to paper. 



### Tonight

* `takingStock`: where are various side projects in the scheme of things? I've ignored some, some are not in my hands, etc. Update whiteboards in the room, email John about `popBuffering`, etc. 

* `thresholdDensity`: keep pushing along. 

* `helmSize`: push along parts that are not the parts that other people said they would collectively work on more than a month ago and haven't done anything on yet.

* ``:



## What should I be working on now? 

* `thresholdDensity`: get edits finalized ASAP

* `rangeLean`: some more plotting and writing

* `checkerBoard2`: keep pushing along the preliminary analysis and figure creation

* `dishes`: lots and lots of dishes piled up and showing no signs of stopping. Many of undergrad team may be experiencing a bit of senior-itis or senior-busyness. Go through some of them tomorrow night.
