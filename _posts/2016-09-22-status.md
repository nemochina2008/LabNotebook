## What have I worked on?

* `parasiteRange`: pushed along. Preliminary plotting. Got Colin up to speed with Github, and he is running range models currently. Promising project.

* `networkEWS`: UC Davis IT + mandatory Windows machine means my machine got updated and restarted last night, so simulations were lost. Ran a portion today. Haven't delved much into them though.

* `tempVarInfection`: final files submitted

* `OAfund`: sent inquiry about UC Davis OA publishing fund

* `rangeShape`: found new data source. Found citations for all existing data sources, and updated methods section for clarity and citations.



### Tonight:

* `parasiteRange`: continue protocol dev

* `zika`: clean up code and make sure everything is ready for release


## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: added one more fish data source, so re-run analyses for these species, and update manuscript text and plots. If the amount of data is a sign of the quality of the manuscript, this manuscript is top notch. Needs conceptual figure and maybe some edits to enhance intro and methods flow

* `reading`: have a stack of articles on how biotic interactions affect distributions, but I still can't wrap my around how to tease apart similar environmental tolerances from competition. Seems hinky, but hoping to be shown how it's possible.
