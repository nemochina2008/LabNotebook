## What have I worked on?
 
* `missingLinks`: checked in with John about this project and gave status update on two others. 

* `priorityEffects`: run sim, fit sim, sim with fit parms, compare.

* `labMeetingTalk`: giving a talk in lab meeting on Wednesday. Tossing together some quick slides. 

* `checkerBoard1`: some simulations from model to bolster empirical results. Need to sit down and think about how to frame analytical results. One new figure and a bit of text dev.






### Tonight

* `graphDissim`: Figure out weird US states that are getting excluded. 

* `checkerBoard1`: methods dev and skeletal results



## What should I be working on now? 

* `popBuffering`: manuscript edits 

* `betaRange`: push along conceptually. Give it a skeleton. 

* `checkerBoard`: push along 1. Almost done with gen 3, so that's neat.
