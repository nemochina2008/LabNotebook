## What did I work on today (and for few days since I've posted)?

* Lab meeting, TA meeting, coffee hour, First Friday (booze)

* Meeting with Paola to discuss steps forward for `globalHelminth`

* `resistanceCosts`: edits close to complete

* `globalHelminth`: started fleshing out manuscript text

* Worked on Omidyar application 






## What should I be working on this weekend?

* `srsMetacom`


* `globalHelminth`


* `resistanceCosts`: Finalize those edits, make sure everything is on point, and re-submit.






## Soon!

* `VerticaBd`: talked it over with Drew. Some ways forward (temporal cutoff for old data, removal of absence records where _Bd_ was later found, etc.)
