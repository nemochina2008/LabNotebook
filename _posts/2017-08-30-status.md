## What have I worked on?
 
* `scramble`: manuscript structure added. 

* `rangeLean`: chatted with Robin about model progress. 

* `centConserve`: obtained and organized host and pathogen trait data, and snagged country-level data as well. Ran models and formatted them for manuscript. I think it's writing time. 

* `normalNiche`: wrote some code. thought about some math stats stuff. thoroughly confused myself. think on this tonight and get the data formatting and model training stuff pushed forward. 



### Tonight

* `centConserve`: format data and play around with models

* `normalNiche`: get code running. 


## What should I be working on now? 

* `centConserve`: conceptual progress needs to be made

* `normalNiche`: think/read about the statistical approach

* `abundanceSDM`: check on sims. When done, make plots, and update supplement
