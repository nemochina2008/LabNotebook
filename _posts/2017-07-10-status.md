## What have I worked on?
 
* `professionalService`: reviewed article (didn't get a chance to do much over the weekend)

* `howManyHelminths`: Colin has been pushing this forward solidly. I got caught up to speed, and did a bit of reading and mapping.

* `smbTalk`: finished slides. Worked through what I wanted to say on each slide. Now it's time for the minor tweaking and re-arranging of slides. 

* `flatEarth`: formatting 






### Tonight

* `sizeDistro` 

* `reading`

* `rangeShape`: check on running code and polish responses to smaller concerns. 




  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `flatEarth`: formatting

* `centConserve`

* `rangeLean`: text edits and check-in with Robin about model
