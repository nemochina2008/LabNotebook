## What have I worked on?
 
* `checkerBoard2`: fleshed out intro, methods, and results. Sketched out outline for discussion. This took most of the day. 
  
* `labMeeting`: Lauren gave a talk on Marine Protected Areas in California. 

* `experimentIdea`: thought of one short-term experiment. Desire is to come up with a handful of 1-2 generation experiments that will inform modeling efforts. A generation time distribution experiment could be interesting.





### Tonight 

* `run`

* `experimentIdeas`: sketch out some ideas. 





## What should I be working on now? 

* `checkerBoard2`: keep writing

* `rangeLean`: read it and get ready for model code from Robin so we can start plotting.
