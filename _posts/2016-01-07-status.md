## What did I work on today?

* `srsMetacom`: edits and polishing. Sent out to the group today with a decently polished manuscript and a list of potential reviewer concerns (i.e., areas to either guard against or further explore).

*  `read`:  Read these solid papers.  [2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/ele.12548/full), and [3](https://peerj.com/preprints/1589.pdf), and a few pages from _Chaos in Ecology_

* `thresholdDensity`: kept plugging away. some minor model adjustments, and a fixed one tiny tiny bug.

* `hostRange`: Dusted this one off and worked on it some. Need a better measure of accuracy. Something that penalizes for a large predicted range. Pushed along some of the plotting, wrote up manuscript skeleton, and made a `Makefile` for this (and future) LaTex manuscripts.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `read`: too many good articles not to (e.g., [this](http://www.eve.ucdavis.edu/sschreiber/reprints/amnat-15b.pdf), and [this](https://bd6b9431-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/rudolfrohr/publications/TREE_2015.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crGdus_QdPgfMG3GeyE0WkSk08ldafwcJqFWStGjolTyDVk642RCbWYnaOUFc5KfW5vsFUbUgCWfdrrhZ_RfNt-PwHpsydWY1oAwDPTBEqZsHQr5R4jeESq9hgpPtiiYv-QbNLYkP9l96fuLo9ddJJjp_Dd1BlFfeTecCSUDTvRRzoLB7feNPqKg8rEzRxUxf6T6oDjVfPzx2VcVzeImTmNoEdDOz6WyPWzsGww3vufEqayW5E%3D&attredirects=0))

* `hostRange`: continue to plug away at it, and talk to John about the ways to measure accuracy that would penalize large estimated ranges.

* `thresholdDensity`: it will never end. More model modifications and bug checks.
