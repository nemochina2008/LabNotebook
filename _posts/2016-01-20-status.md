## What did I work on today?

* `thresholdDensity`: Poisson processes are cool. Figured out analytical invasion probability, and ran models.

* `hostRange`: accuracy and bias measures of range prediction. Running models on simulated data currently. Error isn't relative to anything, which kind of sucks.

* `srsMetacom`: made sure the supplement reflected change in magnitude measure, proofread, small edits, and sent along to collaborators


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `hostRange`: continue to push this along

* `thresholdDensity`: Plot analytical solution, do other stuff.
