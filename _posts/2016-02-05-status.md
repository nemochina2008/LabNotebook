## What did I work on today?

 * `tempVar`: experimental running

* `labMeeting`: good stuff

* `dissertation`: introduction edits from Meghan. Need to go through and make science talk good.

* `srsMetacom`: writing and editing (passed to Drew after for his comments)



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `thresholdDensity`: writing and editing





## late night or weekend

### (because Julie is in the field)

* `fishParasite`: push along the text and create final plots (should host tax even go in the paper, or should I shunt it to the supplement? )

* `thresholdDensity`: tighten up language, and edit results, discussion, and supplement in order to reflect new findings

* `georeference`: finish it off.
