## What have I worked on?
 
* `metacom`: student working with Willig found some differences between Matlab and R code outputs. Trying to get to the bottom of things. 


* `jobApp`: worked on cover letter and research statement


* `RCNcomplex`: discussed a project that Andrew has been pushing along. Quickly read through code, but need to look at it in more detail. 
  



### Tonight 

* `centConserve`: implement Katz centrality

* `RCNcomplex`: read through code if you have time





## What should I be working on now? 


* `ESA`: flying out Sunday for a week of science. Hooray!!!
