## What have I worked on?

* `hostRange`: friendly review comments in. Responded to comments with some edits. Currently going through a bit more simulation to explore other measures of bias and accuracy.

* `zika`: provided last read-through before submission. Manuscript looks really great. Michelle killed it.

* `rangeShape`: sketched out discussion flow.



### Tonight

* `flatEarth`: finalize edits and pass to John. got held up making sure translating hexbins to geographic space was working correctly.

* `rangeShape`: conceptual figure for main text

* `nodeProperties`: start slogging through the discussion



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: keep working on what you can of discussion

* `labLogistics`: stock maintenance and `AME`. Start of week 5 for `priorityEffects`
