## What did I work on today?

* Re-submitted `helminthR` note

* Got code running for the `fishParasite` stuff (the solution was borderline embarrassing straight-forward)

* Cold e-mailed some potential postdoc advisors (`#Icanhazpostdoc?`)

* E-mailed committee about `tempVar` chapter

*




## What should I be working on tomorrow

* Continue to format dissertation in LaTex

* Push along some RCN projects
  + `nodeProperties`: scrape WoS, make sure 0 prev records aren't included
  + `globalHelminth`: finalize list of macroecological hypotheses and start working through them
  + `hostRange`: simulate host-parasite occurrence data

*
