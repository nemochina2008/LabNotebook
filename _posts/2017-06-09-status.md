## What have I worked on?
 
* `macroHelminth` and `helmSize`: revived, but made only minor text edits. Mainly just refreshed my memory. Will push along `macroHelminth` statistical stuff tonight.


* `nodeProperties`: cleaned up comments and made sure everything has been addressed. Waiting for Patrick to green-light, but will continue to make minor tweaks and get materials prepared for submission. 

* `microcosms`: Wrote some words

* `checkerBoard2`: worked on some aspects of the supplemental materials and tightened up some of the text. 




### Tonight


* `smallExperiments`: write up `genTime` protocol and sat and thought about other short-term experiments

* `macroHelminth`: stats for SAR stuff.







## What should I be working on now? 

* stuff and things! I'll think about this more over the weekend.
