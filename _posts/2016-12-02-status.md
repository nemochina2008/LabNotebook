## What have I worked on?

* `hostRange`: responded to and incorporated Shan's edits. Trimmed abstract down. Nearly ready to submit

* `missingLinks`: incorporated Andrew's comments. Both coauthors gave _green light_ and I plan to submit over the weekend or early next week.


* `extinctionTime`: worked on fitting different tail distributions. Not sure if I have enough populations to really look at extinction time distros in this fashion. 


* `macroHelminth`: parallelized NODF analysis, but will run on home workstation instead of farm cluster.

* `farm`: fiddled around with farm cluster, just to get familiar with SLURM, the job manager, etc. 

* `rangeLean`: Robin updated code. Time to play around with it. Asked IT to install VisualStudio on my computer so I can work in C++ (gcc and g++ are bonking with her code, and I still can't figure out why). 







### Tonight

* `nodeProperties`: update family info and small text tweaks



## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: review manuscripts.

* `dispersalTrait`: try out oil-based paint pens as way to mark beetles.

* `missingLinks`: submit

* `priorityEffects`: stuff
