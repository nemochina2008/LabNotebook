## What have I worked on?

* `fishParasite`: manuscript accepted. Make sure code and data are ready to go.

* `tempVarInfection`: revisions requested. Looks promising. Second to last PhD chapter to be published (other is `thresholdDensity` which is in review). Got the repo set up with the skeleton for responses, but haven't started responding yet.

* `reading`: Trying to get my spatial population dynamic theory on. [1](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12080-015-0271-y), [2](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17513758.2015.1020576), [3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01643.x/full),
[4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2769.pdf)



## What should I be working on now?

* Idk. Stuff. Specifically postdoc stuff. Have done a lot of reading on spatial population dynamics. Working on outlining interesting questions, and exploring what we have data on.
