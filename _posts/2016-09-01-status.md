## What have I worked on?

* `rangeShape`: Firmed questions, set up workflow to address each question point by point, and sketched out informative plots (both conceptually and some code laid down). More data for the data machine!

* `reading`: [Price and Kirkpatrick 2009](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30244963.pdf), [Hochberg and Ives 1999](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3683036.pdf), among some re-reading of others.

* `moving`: half day today becuase I need to move all my stuff (and 1 cat) to a different location.



## What should I be working on now?

* `parasiteRange`: draft protocol sometime in the evening or weekend

* `rangeShape`: work on getting more data sources, preferably ones where trait data are also available.

* `networkEWS`: keep thinking about the model you have, and how you could use it. Perhaps have a chat with Alan about potential questions along this theme soon.
