## What have I worked on?
 
* `sizeDisro`: sieve out adults and place in fresh media. Take pictures tomorrow when adults discarded (be sure to separate the two species treatments--no need to count though).

* `graphDissim`: emailed potential collaborator


* `priorityEffects`: polishing in prep for meeting later this week. 

* `fail`: tried to figure out a way to use OCR-tools to make data entry easier on undergrad team, but reading handwritten digits from scanned table pdfs is way trickier than I thought it would be. 

* `helmSize`: Found a bug. Fixed the bug. Manuscript updated.




## What should I be working on now? 


* `helmSize`: get in collaborators' hands soon

* `checkerboard`: push along

* `priorityEffects`: prepare for submission
