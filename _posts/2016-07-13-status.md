## What have I worked on?

* `deterioratingEnv`: looks solid. Needs to be shared with team, but will take backburner to priorityEffects (it arrived in my mind first).

* `priorityEffects`: sent to team. Ramping up stocks and should be able to start this in the next month or so (beetles are so much slower than _Daphnia_!)

* `popBuffering`: a bit of new life, but Gabe and I agree that while interesting, it could get shot down by a mean reviewer. Some model development, but need to think about testable predictions/take-aways.


## What should I be working on now?

* `roleConservation`: push along tonight.

* `reading`: slowly working my way through _Stochastic Population Processes_. Putting this here to hold myself accountable.
