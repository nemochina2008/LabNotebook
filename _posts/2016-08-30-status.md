## What have I worked on?

* `fishParasite`: released code and data on figshare, corrected proofs, and that article is now in the pipeline. Cool.

* `zika`: updated the variable importance plots last night.

* `reading`: [1](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1784/20133221.short) and lots of macroecological papers

* `rangeShape`: sketched out a bit of the manuscript skeleton, but went down some reading rabbit holes...which is good because it's giving me a better context for my idea.


## What should I be working on now?

* `zika`: Provide manuscript comments to Michelle.

* `rangeLimit`: Keep sketching out a manuscript outline. Draft thesis paragraph. Sketch out what plots will be most informative.
