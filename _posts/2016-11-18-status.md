## What have I worked on?

* `hostRange`: re-ran analyses and changed text to match. No result changed, and the paper looks solid. Sent email to collaborators soliciting small edits.

* `labMeeting`: got to hear a bit about Easton's research during Hastings lab meeting today. It was cool.

* `popBuffering`: made small edits to the manuscript

* `reading` [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecm.1242/epdf), which I'll definitely re-visit.

* `colin`: touched base with Colin about ongoing projects; one of which should be picking up now, and the other is the `extinctionChapter` which is largely on my desk. I need to read more before I can _really_ write much more though.



## What should I be working on now?

* `stochPopProcesses`: continue reading. Get through at least another chapter this weekend.

* `parasiteSAR`: needs a lot more conceptual development before I dive in

* `extinctionTime`: revive this project on _Daphnia_ pop dynamics to look at extinction time distros.
