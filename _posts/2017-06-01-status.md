## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeLean`: worked on tightening up manuscript text and finding the real hooks. Will know more once we get model details ironed out. 

* `checkerBoard`: Easton found a little bug in my code. Fixed bug. One more perk of sharing code.

* `thresholdDensity`: Chop chop chop. Lots of edits. Spent most of the day on this. Passed on to John and Marty for comments. Read some of the super duper wrong comments from one reviewer of the rejected manuscript, and now I'm annoyed. Academic publishing is a stupid and stochastic process. 




### Tonight 

* `run`: 7+ miles with GVH (add-on if I feel good)

* `dishes`: Listen to garbage music (maybe just podcast it?) and do a bunch of lab dishes. 




## What should I be working on now? 

* `sideProjects`: plenty to select from `centConserve`, `dietBreadth`, `flatEarth`, `srsSuccession`

* `skillz`: Brush up on Julia and actively force yourself to use it for a project. Look into Dat. Seems pretty nifty for versioned data. I'll likely just continue to use Github and figshare, but nice to know what's out there. 

* `rangeLean`: More manuscript edits? Waiting on a reasonable tolerance function for better model integration. 

* `checkerBoard2`: Focus on gen 1 results (?) and push forward. Some combination of plotting and writing.
