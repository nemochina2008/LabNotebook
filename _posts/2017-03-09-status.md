## What have I worked on?
 
* `dispersalTrait`: pushed along theory side. Wrote model code. Made 2 good plots and lots of garbage plots. Again, spent pretty much the entire day on this project. I don't know why I'm so focused on this project. It's borderline myopic.



### Tonight 

* `helmSize`: A nice change of gears. See what has to be done here. Push along some of the discussion writing and make sure figures are all top quality. 

* `graphDissim`: Sit down and pound out a skeleton of an introduction, focusing on thesis paragraph. What has been done, and how does this push science forward?






  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `hostRange`: edits and responses

* `priorityEffects1`: small tweaks

* `hostUtility`: push forward conceptual outline/motivation

* `dispersalTrait`: plenty to do here with respect to analysis and writing.
