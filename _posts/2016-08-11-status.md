## What have I worked on?

* `hostRange`: small edits and sent along for friendly review
* `srsMetacom`: getting ducks in a row
* `reading`


## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: still working on data analysis pipeline. 3 datasets now share a common format, but the other will take some effort. Bare bones analysis pipeline setup, but needs some work.

* `zika`: run final models and make sure entire workflow is reproducible




## Weekend

* `helminthR`: updates to take vector of names _or_ separate `genus` and `species` arguments

* `laselva`:  may use the data for `rangeShape`, so might as well see if I can contribute anything useful to the R package (https://github.com/ropenscilabs/laselva)
