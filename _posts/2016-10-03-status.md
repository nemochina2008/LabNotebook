## What have I worked on?

* `rangeLean`: delved into data further. Made a couple prelim plots. Need to flesh out main thrusts of manuscript. 1) Asymmetry over time, 2) mean asymmetry, 3) latitudinal gradient in environment as a potential explanation (present, but doesn't explain anything).

* `rangeShape`: Restricted tree data to continental US. Will re-run analyses on home machine this evening.

* `lecturePrep`: prepared lecture notes for guest lecture in Alan's class



### Tonight

* `cvWebsite`: update CV and website with the bioRXiv pre-print, and other small tweaks.

* `lecturePrep`: more lecture prep.


## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeLean`: develop manuscript skeleton

* `guestLecture`: A year ago, I would've laughed if I had been told I'd be lecturing in place of Alan. Big shoes to temporarily fill.

* `labLogistics`: make sure everyone is on same page as we start generation 2 of `priorityEffects`. Can't afford to mess this up now.
