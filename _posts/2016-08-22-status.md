## What have I worked on?

* `gabe`: helped Gabe Gellner pack up for his move to Colorado. Sad to see him go, but sure he'll do great things.
* `thresholdDensity`: discussed reviewer comments with John and Marty (ongoing)
* `priorityEffects`: setting up experiment, and making sure everybody is on the same page with logistics
* `srsMetacom`: final files submitted
* `e4Award`: seems like a cool opportunity, so I drafted a review proposal and will submit it later this week.
* `jobApps`: preparing materials


## What should I be working on now?

* `reading`: I have a bit of a backlog, even though I've been reading a lot. Reading begets reading, right?
* `priorityEffects`: start of the experiment!
