## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeShape`: code repository nearly ready to go. Need to update when supplemental analyses finished. 


* `genTime`: updated protocol to be a mashup of what was previously called `sizeDistro` and the previous iteration of `genTime`. It seems like a good protocol, but will be a bit of chaos in implementation. 


* `rangeLean`: worked a little on the text. Hopefully will sit down with Robin soon and see what the model can tell us. 


* `normalNiche`: ideas ideas ideas ideas. Lots of reading. Some writing.





### Tonight


* `abundanceSuit`: Idea for secondary project utilizing some of the data from `rangeShape`. 

* `rangeShape`: push along edits


  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `rangeShape`: continue pushing along
