## What have I worked on?
 
* `emergence`: still data munging for now. 

* `scramble`: experiment started today. Exciting!

* `ropensciApp`: meeting to talk words

* `HPnest`: playing around with some stuff, but nothing to really speak of yet

* `spatExtinct`: bug checking in simulation code. Don't try to do normal operations on raster objects. Use raster functionality (e.g., rasterToPoints) whenever possible. 



### Tonight


* `spatExtinct`: simulations and bug checking

* `crisisAversion`: read through and provided comments



## What should I be working on now? 

* push `HPnest`, `numRecords`, and small exploratory projects into more concrete space

* `ivanProject`: undergrad interested in research. Sit down with him next week to discuss what kind of projects would be possible. Find a paper or two that may interest him. Try to get an idea of what he's most interested in. 

* `normalNiche`: implement data cleaning protocol and get this going. Drop Oliveira for now.
