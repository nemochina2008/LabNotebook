## What did I work on today?

* `beetle`: logistical meeting with Alan and Brett. Excited to get to work on this stuff!

* `nicheClass`: made hexbin plot with both groups of points on same plot. Also made sure (ish) that hexbin environments are properly translated into geographic space.

* `VerticaBD`: Pushed this along a bit.

* `srsLabProject`: did my fair share of html and js coding today.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar` population: much needed reading and thinking.
