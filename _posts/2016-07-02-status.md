## What have I worked on?

* `beetleReading`: lots of cool stuff done in this system, and plenty more interesting question to be addressed.
* `deterioratingEnv` and `priorityEffects` sent to team. Hopefully we'll discuss them on Tuesday, and I can work to improve them.
* `netDissim`: tried running it with abundance data and hit weird LAPACK error.
* `thresholdDensity`: gave one last read through, and asked collabs if they are ready to sign off on ms

## What should I be working on now?

* `netDissim`: figure out LAPACK error.
* `broadReading`: I've been a bit myopic late, and need to take some time to read science outside of my bubble.
