## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeShape`: Modified `formatData` and `getRangeInfo` functions to flexibly take either occupancy or abudance data (and by flexibly I mean there's a crap ton of `if` statements now. 
  

* `graphDissim`: some final edits (I swear). Made the network plot and toss it in the supplement; add ref to second results paragraph. Will submit early next week.


* `missingLinks2`: started structuring the manuscript a bit (rough skeleton). Pushed along data formatting and analysis. Asked John about how plug-and-play deals with factor variables. 








### Tonight 


* `relax`: Driving to Berkeley, maybe read some of the _The Moon is Down_, drink a beer or two, maybe run in the Berkeley hills, eat good food...








## What should I be working on now? 

* `rangeShape`: edits and supplemental analyses
 
* `missingLinks2`: analysis

* `flatEarth`: edits (it was rejected from _Science_ ... womp womp)
