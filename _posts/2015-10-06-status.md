## What did I work on today?

* `resistanceCosts`: edits complete. 

* `nodeProperties`: some promising findings and a clear way forward. Strike at this while iron is hot.

* "How to teach" class/prep for labs tomorrow

* Postdoc stuff
  * research statement writing (misery)
  * CV tweaks



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `nodeProperties`

* `srsMetacom`

* `globalHelminth`

* Teach labs (oof)




## Soon!

* `VerticaBd`: talked it over with Drew. Some ways forward (temporal cutoff for old data, removal of absence records where _Bd_ was later found, etc.)
