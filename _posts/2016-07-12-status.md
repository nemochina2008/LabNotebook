## What have I worked on?

* `parasiteExtinction`: sexy project with a diverse group. Provided comments on the manuscript draft.

* `fishParasite`: minor revisions! Incorporated them and responded. Need to write cover letter, and make sure figures and everything are on point.

* `deterioratingEnv`: made some small edits to model, and did a bit of estimation as to when the empirical side of this project can start.

* `priorityEffects`: changed model around. Old estimates for species interaction coefficients simply cannot be trusted. I either need to find a different data source, parameterize independently, or obtain estimates by fitting model to experimental data. Middle one makes the most sense to me.


## What should I be working on now?

* `cannibal`: Keep trudging along. Maybe talk to Alan about my approach soon-ish.

* `nodeProperties`: Charlie made some comments that need to be incorporated/addressed.

* `roleConservation`: maybe push this along if you have time?
