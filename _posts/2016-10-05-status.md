## What have I worked on?

* `rangeLean`: worked on prettying up plots. The exciting code ran last night, but took forever and needs to be run again because of dumb bug. That will be tonight's activity.

* `beetleTeam`: met with undergrads to discuss lab stuff, data validation, telling Excel to speak cells, new hires, `priorityEffects` experimental maintenance, etc.

* `guestLecturePrep`: prepped for lecture. Took silly good notes, and have worked examples to fall back on. eigenvalues smeigenvalues.

* `rangeShape`: checked on data request only to see it hadn't actually been submitted. Not TRY's fault for delay in data access. All my own. Submitted request.

* `library`: Vellend's _The Theory of Ecological Communities_ is on hold for me. Stoked to dive into that.



### Tonight

* Went to bar trivia instead of working on `nodeProperties` and `macroHelminth` last night (work-life balance win?). Will push along `nodeProperties` discussion section this evening.


## What should I be working on now?

* `guestLecture`: Finding real-valued solutions to second order equations when your eigenvalues contain imaginary parts.

* `rangeLean`: if I get the models running early enough, they'll be done by tomorrow morning, and I can start pushing along plotting code, results, and discussion.
