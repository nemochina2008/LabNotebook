## What have I worked on?

* `srsMetacom`: proofs sent in. Pretty pretty pretty.

* `bookChapter`: reading and some sketching out of flow/initial writing.

* `website`: Kind of a time waste, but I made my website prettier. If I put it on here, it makes it seem like I accomplished more. I also read a couple chapters of Vellend's book. I'm on the empirical instances of selection chapter, and I would've written so many notes in the margins if I didn't have some paper handy, and if it wasn't a library book. Cool stuff.


## What should I be working on now?

* `prevOcc`: edit experimental protocol per Alan's suggestions
