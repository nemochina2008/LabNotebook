## What have I worked on?
 
Struggling with USB 3.0 issues on virtual machine, which is why I haven't updated this in awhile. Found a $25 machine at the campus surplus with no OS, tossed Ubuntu on it, and am now using it to do much of my writing and day-to-day stuff. Once our cluster is back up, I should be set. 

* `professionalService`: reviewed 2 articles. 

* `priorityEffects1`: Incorporated Brett's changes. Have a decently solid draft. Up simulation number for final figures (tonight). Pushed along the phase plots and such, but have some questions for Brett and Alan. 

* `dispersalTrait`: pictures are on the `beetle` drive. Initial plots are conceptually sketched out. 

* `helmSize`: Folded Alonso's edits into introduction. Tweaked figures, and worked a bit on methods and results. Good stuff. 
 
* `hostRange`: major revision requested (a reject with invitation to resubmit). 58ne of the reviews were damning, and changes should be straightforward to incorporate.

* `missingLinks`: minor revisions requested. Thorough and positive reviews. Stoked to incorporate them and get this work out in the wild. 

* `graphDissim`: code finished running. Preliminary plots are intriguing. Need to sit down and sketch out conceptual manuscript flow. I see one clear main point, but it takes 2-3 for a manuscript to form. 


* `hostUtility`: new project idea. Currently pushing along conceptually. Have a simulation framework, but haven't coded anything up yet. 






## What should I be working on now? 

* `dispersalTrait`: beetle picture time (tonight?)


* `checkerboard`: data entry, model dev, etc.


* `priorityEffects1`: analytic solution for coexistence time, up simulation number, etc. (run simulations in parallel on home machine)


* `thresholdDensity`: _Am Nat_ rejected. I had high hopes. I thought we addressed reviewer concerns, but in the end they passed. Get prepared to submit to _Ecology_.
