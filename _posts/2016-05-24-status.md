## What have I worked on?

* `tempVar` population: read a bunch and did some EDA for nearly all the proposed projects. Directory structure there, but data looks a bit messy. Need to read more theory to get a firm idea of hypotheses.

* `website`: updated. Nearly all credit should go to Timothee Poisot, since I think the majority of my website is either borrows code from or is inspired by his lab website.

* `nicheClass`: text edits and incorporation of shifted figure.

* `nodeProperties`: worked on text edits to make manuscript conceptually clearer. Spoke with Andrew as well about discussion formatting and such.


Also did a bunch of life stuff, including packing and getting rid of a lot of stuff. I also mapped out the route that my girlfriend, cat, and I will take across the country. 4 days and a lot of hopefully pretty scenary.

## What should I be working on now?

* `tempVar`: clearly sketch out the hypotheses, where they were generated from, and then if the data support them at all.

* `RCN`: push along some of the projects you've let fall by the wayside. Perhaps most notably, the spatial variation in network properties project could be good to work on.
