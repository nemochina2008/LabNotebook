## What did I work on today?

* Settling back in. Experimental maintenance (`tempVar`), stock tank stuff, dish washing, etc.

* `tempVar`: data entered for population dynamics experiment, and some data beating

* `fishParasite`: add a bit to supplement about sensitivity of model accuracy to background point number for subset of parasites examined (then submit it)

* `KeoghDefense`: Carrie Keogh defended. Presentation was solid.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `RCN`: update meeting. Be prepared to talk about `nodeProperties`, `hostRange`, `macroHelminth`, `helminthR`, `netDissim`, `birdMortality`

* `tempVar`: sketch out protocols for data use. Talk to Reni to see if time series are good enough for her application.

* ``
