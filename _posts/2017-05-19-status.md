## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeShape`: polishing touches. 
  
* `checkerBoard2`: beetles use information on the receiver habitat when dispersing. Compliments some stuff Geoff found. 

* `priorityEffects1`: two-species models still fitting. It's been quite a long time. 

* `detEnvironment`: updated protocol with a better environmental gradient. Should be a neat experiment. Pitch during `beetleMania`. 




### Tonight 

* `checkerBoard1`: Barner's edits, considering appropriate null, text edits for clarity before `beetleMania`


* `prep`: taking a day off to head up to Tahoe for a night of backpacking.




## What should I be working on now? 

* `beetleMania`: academic staycation consisting of a 3 day marathon Skype session with collaborators in Colorado. 


* `priorityEffects1/2`: push along
