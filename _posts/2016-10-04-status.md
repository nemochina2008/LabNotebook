## What have I worked on?

* `rangeLean`: developed manuscript skeleton. Found pretty nice hook, I believe.

* `guestLecture`: could've gone better, but went alright considering I had to learn it all myself beforehand. Read some for Thursday's lecture so I feel a bit more prepared for student questions.

* `labLogistics`:


### Tonight

* `rangeLean`: run code and produce plot or two that gets at what I believe is the hook. Shunt the 3 preliminary reasons to supplement, or maybe cut entirely. Keep non-linear environmental change angle, and include the species richness map but largely as eye candy (be sure to emphasize that richness is not a proxy for competitive pressure).

* `nodeProperties`: push discussion along in preparation to go over this work at the RCN

* `macroHelminth`: if time permits, work on adding in the missing sections and trimming some text down. Right now it doesn't really marry macroecology and disease ecology well, and talks way too much about metabolic relationships. When can we test macroecological _laws_ using helminths? What would we expect to see? What would it mean if they differed?


## What should I be working on now?

* `guestLecture`: read and prepare for this lecture (include more examples)

* `priorityEffects`: a patch of 64 beetles produced 0 beetles in the next generation. This system more frustrating than the _Daphnia_ system. Hands down.
