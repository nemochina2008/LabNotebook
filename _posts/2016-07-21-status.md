## What have I worked on?

* `dispersalTrait`: protocol development after morning Skype with Brett and Alan. Project is a bit unwieldy/infeasible as it stands, but will get more reasonable soon hopefully. Set up some preliminary trials and made data sheets.

* `reading`: A couple papers on the influence of competition on metapopulation stability.

* `labOrganization`: spent some time cleaning up stacks of old data sheets, getting things put away or pitched, taking inventory, ordering more flour, etc.




## What should I be working on now?

* `hostRange`: push along

* `tempVarInfection`: revisions

* `dispersalTrait`: sharpen protocol, and do some more preliminary trials to determine dispersal probabilities.

* `roleConservation`: did some thinking about how to analyze the data, so tomorrow is the day to push this along.
