## What have I worked on?

* `islandBiogeo`: seminar led by Schoener on the theory of island biogeography. I'm crashing it so I can hang out with community ecologists.

* `rangeLean`: made a pretty plot. Read a bunch, and added important citations to introduction. Model is being pushed along by Robin.

* `reading`: mainly for `rangeLean`

* `markingBeetles`: preliminary experiments marking individual beetles. Difficult but possible.

* `nodeProperties`: made pretty graph. passed to collaborators after triple-checking manuscript flow and updates to tables and figures.





### Tonight

* `nodeProperties`: quadruple-check the family names of important host taxa. I'm pretty sure they are correct, but it doesn't hurt to check.




## What should I be working on now?

* `RCN`: slide prep and pushing projects along to good places. Pack for travel. Update laptop that you haven't opened in like 3 months.

* `priorityEffects`: work on analytical workflow, and start to sketch out manuscript introduction?


* some other stuff that I'll figure out tonight. Lots of projects are in collaborators hands, currently being run, or in some stage where I can't push them forward.
