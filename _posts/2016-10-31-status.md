## What have I worked on?

* `WOS`: set up repo and sketched out some issues to guide our way forward. Cool project idea, and I'm excited to see this get pushed along.

* `hostRange`: changed up a couple figures. Tiny tweaks. Ready to submit once coauthors green light it.

* `priorityEffects`: Thought more about analysis, and sketched out potential plots. Read Melbourne's model fitting code for single species. May have figured out two complimentary analytical workflows, but would like to discuss with Alan.

* `macroHelminth`: Wrote a bit and made plan of attack for incorporating suggestions from coauthors. Side note: the developer of `helminthR` is as skilled in R package writing as he is handsome. People should use the package to access the 200K+ host-helminth records contained in the db.

* `OAfund`: applied for funding from UC Davis to offset OA article charges

* `labLogistics`: sorting out flour situation. Contributed to data validation effort.



## What should I be working on now?

* `hastingsMeeting`: prepare for meeting.

* `macroHelminth`: Re-snagging data leaving genus-level records out.
