## What have I worked on?
 
* `appliedMath`: learned about the isoperimetric problem. Going to need to sit down and read more of that calculus of variations text before I understand what I just scribbled down. 


* `helmSize`: discussed project organization with Alyssa. Got on the same page. What started as a two person project has now attracted 8 collaborators! Exciting stuff. 

* `checkerboard`: data entered, but not validated. 


* `priorityEffects2`: made some plots of growth rates over the 3 gens of experiment. Calculated slopes of population trajectories in the multivariate space of initial abundance. Calculated distance among all points in multivariate space regardless of generation (2800**2 distance calculations). Distance calculation may take a bit. Should've parallelized it, but still working on stupid 2 core machine while our lab cluster is down. 


* `thresholdDensity`: Marty green-lit resubmission with a couple small tweaks. Wrote cover letter, and will work on resubmission tomorrow.



### Tonight

* `helmSize`: Time to organize the repo and start pushing this forward a bit more. My hope is that if I provide an understandable file structure, analytical workflow, and manuscript skeleton, everybody will be able to contribute and the project will be a breeze. On the other hand, getting 8+ Github beginners to collaborate on the analysis and writing of a manuscript is terrifying. 

* `arc`: easy 7 miles is goal. Find treadmills not awkwardly overlooking basketball courts is ancillary goal. 



  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `priorityEffects2`: KNN distance matrix to compare slope as a function of generational difference and distance in phase space. Final component needs more work. 

* `beetleTeam`: meeting with Brett and Alan. Prep some stuff to have in hand on both `priorityEffects1` and `priorityEffects2`. Play around with simulating two species data and fitting to it. 

* `thresholdDensity`: resubmit.
