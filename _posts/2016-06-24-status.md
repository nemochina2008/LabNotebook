## What have I worked on?

* `srsMetacom`: looks great (IMO). Sent to collaborators for comments.

* `nodeProperties` pushed to collaborators hands

* `hostRange`: currently with John, as he's going to help me address the conceptual issue I had with the way we were assessing model fit to empirical data.

* `fishParasite`: revisions submitted. Fingers crossed.

* `deterioratingEnv`: protocol written, but will need to be tweaked before I send off to Alan and Brett.

* `netDissim`: collaboration with Piet examining the role of the environment and host community as determinants of parasite community structure. Cool project, but still pretty nascent.

* `zika`: provided comments and edits to the current draft. Paper looks really neat, though it puts me out of my comfort zone with regards to the likelihood of the media picking it up and mangling it.

* `beetleReading`: old natural history-esque papers, newer population dynamic papers. I'm full spectrum trying to understand the background/context of the system.


## What should I be working on now?

* `beetleReading`: more more more. Need to especially identify "theory-full" areas. Brett will be passing along data and code soon for the `stableRange` project, so I need to take advantage of my time before I dive into that.


* `caliChill`: longboard to the farmer's market to eat organic stone fruit and play pick-up hacky sack.
