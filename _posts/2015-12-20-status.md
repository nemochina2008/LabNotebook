## What did I work on today?

* `hostRange`: Played around with how the size of the holdout set influences prediction (currently running). If simulations were really a representation of reality, I could predict host breadth pretty well. Something differs between simulations and reality... and that's kind of interesting.

* `VerticaBD`: Cleaned up mapping code.

* `barrigaNet`: Early stage collaboration with Paola Barriga on specialization gradients in host-parasite networks. A bit exploratory currently, but we'll firm up some questions soon.

* `Christmas`: Packed for trip home.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `resistanceCost`: invoice garbage

* `labAutopilot`: make sure things are clean, organized, and clearly labeled with instructions. Assess infection farm, and isolate infected individuals. Keep them fat and happy until death, so spores will be decently fresh when I get back.

* `VerticaBD`: Push this manuscript along. It's good stuff.

* `hostRange`: read for this project. Somebody (!) has tested the performance of Chao estimators along gradients of sites sampled, number of occurrences, probability occurrence, etc.
