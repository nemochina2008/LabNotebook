## What did I work on today?

* Finalized `Competition` edits; prepared to resubmit

* Taught Biol 1108 lab from 12pm - 5pm



## What should I be working tomorrow?

* `Threshold` edits (seemingly never-ending!); discuss issues with John during Friday meeting



### SRS Brain Trust 

Two projects I'm interested in working on now have pretty firm protocols, and some decent headway on analysis (`srsMetacom` and `succession`). More information to come on these projects.



### Macroecology RCN

Has hit the backburner pretty hard, which is bad news bears. Before this coming Sunday, I'll attack some of the projects. 

* `MissingLinks` is nearly ready to hit unfriendly review.
* `GlobalHelminth` has 2-3 different prongs now. This needs solidifying. 
* `NodeProperties` is stalled a bit, but need to examine the possibility of using co-occurrence networks instead of bipartite nets. 


### Keep in mind

* [`FishParasite`](https://github.com/taddallas/FishParasite8910) manuscript nearly ready. Make small tweaks, get John's comments, and then submit

* `VerticaBd` work needs some love. What's the real hook, and what's the target journal/audience?

*
