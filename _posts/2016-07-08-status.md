## What have I worked on?

* `netDissim`: explanatory power hovering at about 10\% variance explained. Not great.

* `thresholdDensity`: submitted. Fingers crossed.

* `deterioratingEnv` and `priorityEffects`: both updated. `priorityEffects` is no longer about priority effects, but I named it that first, and the order at which names arrives matters. Pushed along model for this project (e.g., pop size after 1 generation, time to competitive exclusion, etc.).

* `cannibal`: slowly coming along. Maybe I'll share with Alan in a couple of weeks. Need to work on the analytical determination of the breakpoints between population cycling.



## What should I be working on now?

* `cannibal`: keep trudging along
* `popBuffering`: ugh.
* `priorityEffects`: more model dev
