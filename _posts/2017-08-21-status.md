## What have I worked on?
 
The power stopped working in my office, so I'm working from home for the day. 

* `beetleProjects`: minor tweaks to a couple of plots and small text edits. Waiting on comments from collaborators before submission-fest. 

* `helminthR`: Ran a last `goodpractice` on it, commented on the issue. 

* `job`: can I have one?



### Tonight

* `whiteBoard`: finally update project board at home



  
## What should I be working on now? 

* stuff my updated white board tells me to do

* `rangeLean`: Robin has updated code. Start playing around with it.
 
* `emergence`: spell out approach (trait or traitless?)
