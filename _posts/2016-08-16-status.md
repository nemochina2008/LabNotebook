## What have I worked on?

* `thresholdDensity`: edits. A bit more model exploration as suggested by a reviewer.

* `rangeShape`: laid down some code to look at the difference between geographic space and environmental space with respect to the distribution of host species abundance.

* `reading`: lots and lots.



## What should I be working on now?

* `review`: looks interesting. May save it for when I'm traveling for a wedding (a couple weeks)
