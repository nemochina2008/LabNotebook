## What did I work on today?

* `nicheClass`: developed protocol for project and read a fair amount.

* `tempVar`: prep. On time for a Saturday start. Bubbling the hardwater media now. Tubes clean and ready. Science.

* `hostRange`: found a nice error measure that makes more sense than what I was using. Re-ran simulation analyses, and stuff is looking good.

* `taught`: Mosses and angiosperms!


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `macroHelminth`: add a bit more meat to introduction, and provide a clearer manuscript skeleton.

* `hostRange`: need to flesh out the manuscript and provide a little more backbone
