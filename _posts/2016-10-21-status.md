## What have I worked on?

* `RCN`: Projects are pushed along as far as they will go for now. All collaborators alerted of updates. Clothes set out for travel. Updated laptop and cleared off some old files. Made quick presentation to update RCN folks on developing work.

* `professionalService`: printed off article to review during transit to RCN

* `priorityEffects`: worked on analytical workflow and model dev

* `reading`: [this](http://www.wsl.ch/lud/journalclub/_papers/EcolLett_Hart_etal_2016.pdf)

* `logistics`: new patches came in for beetles, so I unpacked them. They'll need to be washed before we can use them. That'll take some time.

## What should I be working on now?

* `bookChapter`: I am contributing to a book chapter on the mathematics of extinction. Daunting, but I'm stoked.

* `speciesArea`: sketch out idea that's been bouncing around my head
