## What did I work on today?

 It's been awhile since I've updated this. My bad. I'm going to try to keep it updated, and to not use it simply as a to-do list, but to write informative sentences about what I'm up to. Over the past week, I have done the following:

* `metacom` R package is updated on CRAN. Very minor changes, but it was due for an update.

* `fishParasite` manuscript submitted. This one looked at how predictable communities of parasites among fish hosts really are.

* `srsMetacom` nearly submitted. This one looked at metacommunity structure across a set of ephemeral wetlands, and provides support for the Leibold and Mikkelson (2002) framework, extends it in some ways, and offers words of caution to researchers about some potential errors that could creep up.

* `nicheClass` project pushed along solidly. More on this project as it develops.

* `zika`: I'm involved in a project looking at vector-virus pair prediction using machine learning methods. It's been a bit of a slow-go, but we've been getting solid accuracy on our test set, and I've pushed this along to a cool place. My hopes are high for this work, but it's largely in [Michelle's](http://mvevans89.github.io/LabNotebook/) hands.

* `tempVar`: I've been wrestling with questions related to the influence of environmental variance on population and infection dynamics. I have three projects sketched out currently. We'll see if any of them pan out (at least one will).

* `freeData`: I've been working to ensure that all data from my dissertation and other projects is freely available with R code to reproduce my analyses. All of my raw data has been stored internally on lab servers, so now I am shifting my focus to making sure that my code is well annotated and completely reproducible.

* `octave`: For fun, I've been refreshing my knowledge of Octave (open-source Matlab).


Okay. Long list. Getting back into things. Good stuff.

## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar`: continue beating the data up. Need to marry population and individual level experiments in a way that makes sense. Focus on infection analysis and writing.

* `nicheClass`: John wants focus to be less methods or application driven, and more focused on the basic findings. This makes sense, but will require a bit of a re-write of what I currently have. womp womp.
