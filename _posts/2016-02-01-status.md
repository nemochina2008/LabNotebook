## What did I work on today?

* `tempVar`: running. woof.

* `macroHelminth`: Shan created pretty plot. I pushed along manuscript text over the weekend, and have nearly completed the section on nestedness in host-helminth networks. Hoping to get some contributions mailed to me soon.

* `srsMetacom`: incorporated John's edits. Sent along to collabs with some notes about next steps.

* `dissertation`:  incorporated John's introduction edits


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `thresholdDensity`: Read the manuscript, think about final plots, add stochastic model section, clean/annotate code better to place in supplement. This needs to be in committee's hands in a week.

* `georeference`: parasite extinction group. I have like < 200 more points and need to do it.

* `nicheClass`: need to firm up a protocol and pitch the project to John to make sure I'm on solid ground.
