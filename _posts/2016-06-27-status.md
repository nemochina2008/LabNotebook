## What have I worked on?

* `srsMetacom`: John and Drew have signed off on it. I think it's looking pretty solid. Need to find info on word limit to make sure we're good there.

* `deterioratingEnv`: protocol looks pretty solid. Will soon share with Alan and Brett.

* `priorityEffects`: started conceptualizing an experiment examining invasion thresholds and priority effects in the _Tribolium_ system. Seems cool, but needs  a bit more thinking and reading.

* `beetleReading`: my copy of the [beetle bible](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461278238) came in. Some solid weekend reading, with still more to do.


## What should I be working on now?

* `beetleReading` and more protocol dev.

* `netDissim`: I set up the repo, but now I actually need to push the project along. May wait until I'm sure Piet and I are on the same page.

* `labOrganization`: I'm a bit in the dark, and need to not be. Use time with undergrads tomorrow to get a better idea of data storage, file structure, and some experimental stuff. It seems like we could stand to be a bit more organized.
