`PSA`: [Github now offering unlimited free private repos](https://github.com/blog/2164-introducing-unlimited-private-repositories?utm_source=announcement&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ww-otherorg-20160511). Fantastic news.

## What did I work on today?

* `nodeProperties`: made two graphs prettier. More informative figure captions all around. Communicated with coauthors, and will start crafting my part of the discussion with Andrew soon (probably early next week)

* `tempVar ` infection: polished and submitted.

* `hostRange`: found a bug! squished it. Also thought of a cool idea that probably should've occurred to me awhile ago. If I really want to like the simulations to the empirical data, why not fit the empirical data to the distribution that is used to generate simulated data? Now I have estimates that I directly compare to my simulations, which could provide insight into when we can (and when we can't) estimate host range.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `graduation`: picking up my grandpa from the airport. Need to clean car/house/self before so I look like I'm an adult.

* `tempVar`: population: push along `EWS` and `extinction` subprojects

* `hostRange`: simulations should be done by tomorrow. Check them out and make sure they make sense. Pursue the distro fitting angle and see where it leads. It's a stronger move than looking at evenness, and provides a tighter link between theory and field data.
