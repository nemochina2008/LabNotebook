## What have I worked on?
 
* `checkerboard`: pushed along introduction and smoothed out some sticking points in the methods. Ran simulations parameterized by experimental data. Now need analytic solution section, and eventually need to include experimental data directly (maybe?). 

* `nodeProperties`: project revived after recovering from some conceptual stabs by co-authors. They brought up fair points, and I think I have addressed them in the current manuscript. Need to create one more figure for the supplement (or maybe main text depending where target journal is), and then will send out for feedback tonight or tomorrow.

* `teary`: Drank tea/coffee with people from Shreiber, Baskett, and Hastings labs. 

* `dispersalTrait`: finished data entry, and started exploratory analyses. Not much dispersal occurred, but I think enough did where I can still get at the original question. 






  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `graphDissim`: I'd like to push this along conceptually over the weekend. 

* `macrohelminth` and `helmSize`: push along and invite collaborators to do the same.

* `dishes`: we have lots (4 boxes or so full!!). Time to drink coffee, listen to an audiobook, and push through a few hours of dishes. 
 
* `labProject`: push along my section. 

* `priorityEffects1` and `priorityEffects2`: mainly 2, but 1 could probably use some minor polishing before Brett, Alan, and Geoff comment on it.
