## What have I worked on?
 
* `SMBtalk`: put together slides for the talk. Small text edits on manuscript as well, but mostly just this all day. Good use of time? Not really. Mostly fiddled with fonts and colors of my Beamer template. It'll be the next big thing. Just wait. 


* `reading`: read a bunch of the classic _Tribolium_ papers again (e.g., Park 1948)






## What should I be working on now? 

* `professionalService`: write out notes on manuscript, and provide comments on Easton's paper

 
* `read`: heading to Tahoe this weekend without computer. Time to read and take stock.
