## What have I worked on?

* `hostRange`: incorporated Charlie's comments. Sent back to coauthors for comments.

* `thresholdDensity`: addressed reviewer comments and edited manuscript. Sent to collaborators for comments and help responding to some of the reviewer concerns.

* `priorityEffects`: sketched out a bit more of the analytical workflow, but data hasn't been entered yet for any of generation 2.

* `californiaPlaylist`: there are more songs written about California than any other state. Most about happy and poppy, praising California for being awesome. I thought it'd be funny to make a playlist of songs about how much California sucks (which it doesn't...it's pretty solid). Spotify Discover suggested a solid anti-California this week. Too amusing not to share. Recommender systems at their finest.

* `scienceTalk`: 1pm talk with Meredith, a postdoc at Florida State studying soapberry beetles. Good stuff.



### Tonight

* `rangeLean`: set up code during the day, but need to run code on my home machine. Need to sit and think if this is the best way to test if abundances are determined by climate or population dynamics/dispersal/etc. Hypothetically, if I could predict species abundance accurately using just climate data, it would preclude the influence of dispersal, etc. unless climate somehow captures dispersal dynamics.


* `nodeProperties`: need updated WOS citation counts. Running into firewall issues on campus, so goal is to setup VPN access to campus network tonight from home computer, and run the `RSelenium` script to snag citation counts for all host species.



## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: potentially two additional reviews to do. I've agreed to one, and will likely agree to the second one.

* `rangeLean`: get this pushed along.

* `reading`: Vellend book.

* `macroHelminth`: review article fell by wayside as coauthors worked on sections independently. Now it's in my hands, with some parts done, and some parts sadly never started. Need to push this along before RCN meeting.
