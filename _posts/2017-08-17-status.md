## What have I worked on?
 
* `BEETLES`: demographic parameters updated, along with text polishing of `priorityEffects`, `checkerBoard`,and `dispersalTrait`
  
* `metacom`: bug in BoundaryClump function fixed

* `labLogistics`: a bit of forward planning and ordering of stuff. 


### Tonight 

* `whiteBoard`: still haven't updated home whiteboard

* `centConserve` and `normalNiche`: all the beetle stuff took priority last night, so tonight I'll hopefully push along these two projects. 





## What should I be working on now? 

* `helminthR`: continue prepping for submission. Pretty much ready to go. `goodpractice` it, and then maybe let Scott take a last look through?


* `colin`: Colin is coming in from Berkeley in the afternoon to work on `spatExtinct`, `emergence`, and `howManyHelminths`.
