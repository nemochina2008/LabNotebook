## What did I work on today?

Today was mostly meetings, and logistics, sadly. 

* `GlobalHelminth` data formatting for the extinction project with Colin and team

* Lab prep 

* Meeting with John

* `Competition` final touches and LaTex formatting foibles (made some headway)



## What should I be working on this weekend?

* `Competition`: finalize and submit all materials

* `resistanceCosts`: edits (seem straightforward, but be sure to address them all)

* `srsMetacom`: writing and plotting

* `VerticaBd`: writing before handing to John for inspection

* `Threshold`: John suggested some reading. Read some stuff.

* Omidyar fellowship application (slowly coming together)

### Keep in mind

* Start thinking about defense date (February?) (e-mail committee)
