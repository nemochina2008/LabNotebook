## What did I work on today?

*  `read`:  [1](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/11/26/032938)

* `barrigaNetwork`: updated and sent. Off my desk for now.

* `thresholdDensity`: At first I was proud that I wrote my own Gillespie simulator and the results matched that of the `adaptivetau` package. Then I realized my code is like 4x slower. womp womp. Running some slow simulations to see how model performs.

* `gss`: Wrote `Rmd` script to take a `csv` of presenter information and format it into a pretty little abstract `pdf` with names, affiliations,etc. I'll make the repo public once I make sure there's no objection from Reni.

* `srsMetacom`: incorporated Chris' edits, and did some edits of my own.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `srsMetacom`: focus on sticking to a few main points, and clarify some of the wording (i.e., start the polishing process)

*  `read`:  [2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/ele.12548/full), and [3](https://peerj.com/preprints/1589.pdf).

* `thresholdDensity`: keep plugging away.
