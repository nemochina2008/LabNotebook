## What have I worked on?

* `checkerBoard2`: finalized draft and passed to collabs. Alan said he liked it, with more detailed comments to follow.


* `genTime`: protocol dev. Couple of small issues that may be non-issues concerning experimental design. 


* `beetleLab`: read through cover letters and CVs. Invited some candidates to interview this Friday. 


* `graphDissim`: Tim got back to me. Incorporated his comments, but need to sit and think about analytical approach.


* `colin`: Came up with a good idea, but need to put pen to paper before we forget it and let it die (as per tradition).


* `flatEarth`: distilling ideas into words, and then turning those crappy words into better words.







### Tonight 

* `run`

* `colin`: start writing up this protocol. Be clear about data limitations and analytic approach. 
  





## What should I be working on now? 

* `esaDiseaseMeeting`: morning meeting to discuss logistics and whatnot

* `flatEarth`: continue distillation.
