## What did I work on today?

* `srsMetacom`: finished edits, and passed off to the brain trust for comments

* `macroHelminth`: pushed along analysis and plotting portion pretty far. First attempt at writing a review-style paper. Weird. Need to sit down and actually write instead of just making pretty plots.

* `threshold`: Still thinking on _if_  `R0` makes sense for environmentally-transmitted pathogens. Perhaps [this will help](http://math.cos.ucf.edu/~zshuai/paper/2012jbd.pdf).

* `reading`: [Recent Oikos paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.02803/abstract),
and, [this awesome preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04453)


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `threshold`: Push the idea along. Give it some legs.

* `macroHelminth`: type some words good.
