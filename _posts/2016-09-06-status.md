## What have I worked on?

* `professionalService`: reviewed _Ecology and Evolution_ article
* `tempVarInfection`: minor revisions requested. All manageable. Edited and sent to John for comments.
* `rangeShape`: read article Robin sent. Started working with the SQL dump of the Forest Inventory and Analysis data. Lots of struggles.
* `friendlyReview`: gave some comments to Alyssa Gehman on a cool manuscript looking at the influence of temperature on epidemics of a crab parasite.
* Also convinced the UC Davis library to order _The Theory of Ecological Communities_ by Mark Vellend. Pretty excited about diving into that.


### Tonight

* `run`: traveling has messed my sleep schedule up. Need to get back into a routine. Run.

* `jobApps`: edit CV. Charlie Nunn told me it was a bit too "distracting". Tone down the use of color, and maybe change up the header a bit? Maybe remove all the cat gifs? (jk, there are no cat gifs ... yet)

* `parasiteRange`: Sketch out work with Colin. I've meant to do this for a bit, and there's no time like the present.


## What should I be working on now?

* `networkEWS`: thinking/reading/protocol writing
* `rangeShape`: data munging
* `priorityEffects`: analytical workflow and introduction
