## What did I work on today?

* `nodeProperties`: Writing... and by writing I mean mostly plotting, some table making, and then an honest day's worth of writing (i.e. a few paragraphs).

* `fishParasite`: Worked on some manuscript polishing and passed to John for final edits

* Started to grade student lab reports (oof)



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `macroHelminth`: Analysis
