## What did I work on today?

* `birdMortality`: 11am Skype call to discuss data and questions. Good call, though it made some code I wrote previously pointless (womp womp). Some analyses conceptualized, but it's a bit too data-driven instead of question-driven as it stands. We'll see how things if/when we leave the spitballin' stage and actually put fingers to keyboard on a protocol.


* `macroHelminth`: set higher threshold for number of unique hosts and parasites present, so that summary stats could be calculated. Summary stats are taking a decent among of time and memory to calculate (womp womp # 2).

* `fishParasite`: incorporated John's edits, re-submitted, crossed fingers, and drank a beer.

* `blogPost`: outlined a blog post for the probably happening Drake lab blog.




## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `passport`: Need one (have a postdoc interview abroad in March). Pretty stoked <i class="icon-smile"  style="color:AquaMarine"></i>

* `srsMetacom`: Discussion writing and tweaks to results
