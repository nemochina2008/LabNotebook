## What have I worked on?

* `checkerBoard2`: edits to text and supplement. Within striking distance of 2500 words, but it'd be tough. 

* `srsSuccession`: pushed along for funsies. Lots of other stuff I could be working on I'd need a computer with more than 4Gb of memory, so I have to wait until I get home. Womp womp. 


* `labLogistics`: onboarding for new hires and some dishes. 




### Tonight 

* `centConserve`: continue this analysis/plotting effort

* `graphDissim`: add in stats and polish text




  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `flatEarth`: fire when ready

* `checkerBoard2`: solicit feedback from Brett and Geoff. 

* `smallExperiments`: think of where the beetle system should go this summer. Probably `genTime` is the best bet, but `commSpread` also sounds interesting.
