## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeShape`: Pushed forward supplemental analyses. 
  
* `graphDissim`: Tim green-lit. Will submit soon. Minor text edits today.

* `logistics`: updated all manuscript submission and science accounts with updated email, as UGA is taking away my e-mail address (meanies). 






### Tonight

* `run`: 7 easy-ish miles

* `rangeShape`: cobble supplemental stuff together with current RData file. Check on running code at home. If it's done, push it through the crap pipeline.


* `missingLinks2`: push along








## What should I be working on now? 

* `missingLinks2`: push along

* `rangeShape`: keep plugging away at supplemental analyses to appease reviewer criticisms
