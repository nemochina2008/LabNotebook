## What did I work on today?

* `hostRange`: Updated plotting. Talked to John about it. Good stuff.

* `macroHelminth`: Updated nestedness analysis. Lots of clustering, not much nestedness. Likely due to low matrix fill. Still kind of an interesting finding. Maybe next step is to plot out spatially?

* `thresholdDensity`: Met with John. He seems to think the R0 calculation is correct as stands, and that the problem lies in parameterization. Coded prelim Gillespie simulator, but hit a few bugs that need to be addressed.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `thresholdDensity`: Bug fix Gillespie simulator, and make sure that all model code is correct.

* `hostRange`: Bug checks, and develop a short presentation to clarify things.
