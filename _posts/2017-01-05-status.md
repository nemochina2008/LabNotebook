## What have I worked on?
 
* `popBuffering`: made some more tweaks and passed to John. I want to make sure I'm not just polishing a turd. He said it was a turd. Not really though. Project is live and manuscript is now on Overleaf. 


* `priorityEffects`: plotted out population growth rates in multivariate space, but I'm not sure if this is what Alan was thinking of. Data entry and validation party. 


* `prevOccupancy`: edited protocol. It's a bit more reasonable now, but potentially at the cost of eliminating one of the treatments. 


* `nodeProperties`: Comments from John are not small edits, but rather larger conceptual underpinnings. Need to sit and think how to best address them. Responded to some comments on Overleaf. 





  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `thresholdDensity`: Marty sent some comments along. They look good, and I'll work at addressing them. 
 
* `nodeProperties`: edits and additions

* `popBuffering`: re-structure introduction. Consider addition of model if appropriate. 

* `checkerBoard`: label patches. This is a rest activity from all the thinking required from tasks above.
