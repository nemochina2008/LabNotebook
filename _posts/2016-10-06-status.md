## What have I worked on?

* `guestLecture`: I think it went well. I'm happy with it.

* `hostRange`: incorporated Andrew's edits, and added conceptual figure. I'm not sold on it, but it does help explain the simulated data a bit.

* `jobs`: Applied to one more job, bringing up to 4 applications currently in. I'll be stoked if I get an interview.

* `reading`: checked up on some of my favorite scientists Google Scholar pages to see if I've missed any of their recent work.

* `rangeLean`: worked on text edits. Introduction is pretty sparse currently, and methods need work.



### Tonight

* `nodeProperties`: consider dropping one of the evolutionary distinctiveness measures, and running models again. Finish off discussion section, and consider sending to Barbara directly for text edits and polishing.

* `rangeLean`: models should be finished running, and should give me measures of asymmetry and agreement between models and data. Plot some stuff, and maybe tweak some text.


## What should I be working on now?

* `thresholdDensity`: needs attention. It's good work, and I need to take the steps necessary to get it to the finish line.

* `rangeLean`: assuming models finish running, I'll have no block to pushing this forward.
