## What did I work on today?

* `hostRange`: Pushed text along, and have a solid simulation result. Next stop: results section, and a bit more meat in the introduction.

* `macroHelminth`: gave it a bit more structure. added Shan's nice plot. found appropriate citations for some assertions in the introduction that were uncited.

* `nicheClass`: on Github now, but still a really loose idea. Will push this along in the coming days.

* `tempVar`: make sure tomorrow can go smoothly.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar`: go time.
