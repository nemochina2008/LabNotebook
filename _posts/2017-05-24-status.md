## What have I worked on?
 
* `beetleMania`: officially over.  Lots of paths forward and things to do. Plenty to think about.  Pushed along some of the smaller stuff related to this. 

  
* `hostRange` and `nodeProperties`: Andrew green-lit. Has some ideas for helminth data. Looking forward to some future collaborations. 


* `hobo`: Googled around and started playing with extracting data from a hobo data logger on a linux machine. Hoboware's software seems dumb, and I'd like to avoid using it. 




### Tonight 

* `dishes`: play music loudly and do lots of lab dishes

* `graphDissim`: tap Tim for comments or suggestions. Maybe work on text edits as well? I'm intrigued by the results, but also worried a reviewer will ask that we examine environmental distance as well. This isn't a huge problem, but the calculation of environmental distance is non-trivial given the area/environmental variation in many of the localities. 





## What should I be working on now? 

* `beetleMania`: couple of logistical things to take care of, and then some reading needs to be done before other components can be pushed along.
