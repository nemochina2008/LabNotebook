## What did I work on today?

* `labProject`: made garbage statues.

* `nicheClass`: Code running. Manuscript introduction got a good tune-up

* `fishParasite`: formatting and writing. Passed to Andrew for comments/ideas about how to sell it.

* `dissertation`: All content in. All figures and tables referenced correctly. No missing citations (??). Thank you LaTex. Now just small formatting tweaks as required.

* `tempVar`: late night lab night! PBR + Dinosaur Jr. + spore counting under the scope



## What should I be working on tomorrow
