## What have I worked on?
 

* `normalNiche`: did some troubleshooting on the model training, and it's chugging along again. Currently at about 2500 species.

* `beetleMeeting`: Touching base with Colorado lab. 

* `thresholdDensity`: transfer to Royal Society Open Science

* `priorityEffects`: Brett suggested fitting kE and kD parameters independently for species. Working on setting thatup. 

* `abundanceSDM`: plots and supplemental text




### Tonight

* `spatExtinct`: figure out stupid bugs in vignette code. 

* `rangeLean`: read Robin's incredibly thorough supplemental document about calculating skewness for population density distributions. 





## What should I be working on now? 

* `rangeShape`: make minor revisions and submit final version (make sure under 5000 words)

* `rangeLean`: implement Robin's altered function on the empirical data

* `abundanceSDM`: further text tweaks before passing back to Alan
