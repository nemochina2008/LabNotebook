## What did I work on today?

* `srsMetacom`: Discussion writing and tweaks to results

* `tempVar`: requested spores, and am going to attempt to run one last complimentary experiment before defending. Seeded 3 fresh tanks, and will start neonate farm once I get enough mothers.

* ` macroHelminth`: calculated richness and network structure metrics. Took awhile. Plotted out latitude and longitude relationships. Next need to pull down some country level demographic data, and start working through species-area relationships.

* `reading`: Read a bunch for the threshold host density project (and more generally). What does $R_{0}$ actually mean for an environmentally-transmitted pathogen? (number of secondary infections resulting from the introduction of an infected individual into a wholly susceptible population) ... but what if I'm not introducing an infected individual, but just some of the environmental pathogen!?


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `macroHelminth`: push along

* `threshold`: Sit-read-think
