## What have I worked on?

* `jobApp`: I am an imposter and this is the point where everybody finds out.

* `reading`: lots of reading still. Ramping up for `priorityEffects`, and still conceptualizing some experimental design for `dispersalTrait`.

* `nodeProperties`: ran with family as binary. Everything dropped out like I had hypothesized.


## What should I be working on now?

* `nodeProperties` and `hostRange`: small edits while I wait for larger ones

* `reading`: more dispersal and range limit literature

* `meetWithRobin`: nice scientific discussion of range limits and linking math with experimental systems
