## What have I worked on?
 
* `dispersalTrait`: finalized much of the text, but need to explore two additional things in the Supplement. Will do this tonight. 

* `checkerboard1`: finalized edits and tweaks. Passed along to Allison Barner for friendly review.

* `ESAdisease`: made some sweet stickers for the disease ecology section of ESA. They are nice. You should buy one. 
  
* `reading`: Scarpino "On the predictability of infectious disease outbreaks"

* `labLogistics`: data in binders, dishes in boxes, etc.


### Tonight 

* `run`: easy. If I can wake up, do the 10 miler with GVH tomorrow. 

* `dispersalTrait`: get code running for zeta effect and founder pop size exploration. 



## What should I be working on now? 

* `rangeInteract`: conceptual dev

* `centConserve`(dev, dev, dev), `popBuffering` (respond to reviewers), `hostRange` (tap collaborators), 

* `priorityEffects`: figure out annoying model fitting issue
