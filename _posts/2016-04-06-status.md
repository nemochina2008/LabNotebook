## What did I work on today?

* `nicheClass`: wrote discussion section of paper. Sent to John for thoughts on direction and content before I go too far in one direction.

* `labData`: data on lab website for `nitrate`, `resistanceCosts`, and `competition`.

* `figshare`: got set up.
  * `competition` is done.
  * `resistanceCosts` code was released [alongside manuscript](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.20234).
  * `nitrate` nearly ready, but need to spruce up code (i.e., annotation, making sure appropriate package versions are being called).  
  * `thresholdDensity` project not wrapped up yet.
  * `tempVar` still needs a bit of data entry from recent experiment.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar`: Need to do last bit of lab work

* `DaphniaByeBye`: hand off _Daphnia_ sp. maintenance tasks to Andrea. requires a bit of work to make sure they are all fat and happy, and all algae-filled tanks are washed.

* ``:

* `teach`
