## What have I worked on?

* `rangeLean`: pushed along pretty solidly. Getting advice from Alan and Robin soon.

* `labLogistics`: went to 2 lab meetings (Baskett and Hastings) and interviewed 2 undergraduates for jobs in the beetle lab. It was a day of meetings.

* `reading`: [this](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213224416300396) as it pertains to some RCN work

* `macroHelminth`: Colin is part of this effort now, and provided some comments on the manuscript. I responded to most, and he is going forward with some changes to at least one section.


### Tonight

* `macroHelminth`: manually look up some of the iso3 codes for countries not matched. Need to make pretty map!

* `julia`: if I have time, I'd like to keep sharpening my skills in Julia.


## What should I be working on now?

* `nodeProperties`: build WOS models. Re-create all analyses, figures, and tables with updated GMPD data. edit manuscript text accordingly.

* `professionalService`: perform review.
