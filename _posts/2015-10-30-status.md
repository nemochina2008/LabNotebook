## What did I work on today?

* Meeting with John

* Small edits to `nodeProperties` 

* 

### Prep for RCN

* `speciesRichness`: applying species richness estimators to determine the number of host species a parasite can potentially infect. Hopefully RCN will help with some small issues.

* `insectDisease`: added to slides. Brainstormed ideas. 

* `RCN`: slides done.




## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `globalHelminth`: Needs some writing love. Most of the plots are already made. Now I just need to weave that narrative (i.e. the hard part). 

* Eat candy and watch scary movies

* Grade student lab reports

* Eat **more** candy
