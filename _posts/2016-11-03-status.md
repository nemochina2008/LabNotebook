## What have I worked on?

* `labMeeting`: went to Schreiber's lab meeting to hear Vadim talk about alternative stable states in a tritrophic system.

* `prevOcc`: edited the protocol to see what it would take to incorporate Alan's changes (potentially infeasible amount of patches). Be ready to discuss this during the Monday meeting.

* `labLogistics`: organized patches to get an idea of how many we have, and to make it so that we don't run into stupid situations where we have to wash lids so that we have enough for the day. No good. I'm too much of a control freak to play it so fast and loose.

* `islandBiogeo`: reading group. Discussing [this paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12314/abstract)




* `macroHelminth`: pushed the correction for sampling bias stuff along, correcting some of the plots and such.

* `bookChapter`: more reading and writing

* `mathInvasion`: read and prep for discussing chapter 2 of _Mathematics of Biological Invasions_
