## What have I worked on?
 
* `flatEarth`: typey type

* `esaDisease`: meeting at 11am

* `farm`: played around with getting stuff to run on farm cluster. No permissions, so even installing R packages becomes a bit of a chore. 



## What should I be working on now? 

* `flatEarth`: push along

* `checkerBoard2`: perhaps refine, or just wait for coauthors to comment?
