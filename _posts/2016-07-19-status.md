## What have I worked on?

* `hostRange`: pushed along substantially. All Charlie's comments incorporated, and then some. Plots are looking tight, and message is coming together. Need to push along discussion, and do some polishing.

* `priorityEffects`: modeling component pushed along. Protocol set and ramping up beetle stocks. Data sheets made and ready to be filled in. Don't want to jinx it, but Alan said "this is _Ecology Letters_ material"

* `deterioratingEnv`: model coded up, but need to wait until `priorityEffects` is done before this can really get pushed along.

* `nodeProperties`: Charlie's edits incorporated. Re-made network figure and expanded text.

* `professionalService`: completed review of _J of Vector Ecology_ article.

* `postdoc`: read an undergraduate's project, and analyzed some of the data. It's a bit messy, but kind of interesting, and may inform some tweaks to the `deterioratingEnv` experimental design.

* `nicheClass`: edits to manuscript text, and sent to John for comments.



## What should I be working on now?

* `postdoc`: read more about spatial population dynamics, range limits, and coexistence. Also, read about density-dependent and context-dependent dispersal. I think there's some cool questions there, but want to make sure it's rooted in theory and I'm not just asking the question because it _can_ be asked.

<!-- Is dispersal tendency and dispersal distance a heritable trait? How does environmental context alter dispersal tendency and distance? -->

* `hostRange`: results tweaks, discussion, and deciding what goes into supplement and what gets prime slots in the main text. Maybe thinking of target journal would inform some of those decisions?


## Soon

* `tempVarInfection`: manuscript revisions.

* `roleConservation`:  This Friday, the plan is to have a couple sad beers, listen to some shitty music, and determine if species roles in host-parasite networks are conserved across space.
