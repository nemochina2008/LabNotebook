## What have I worked on?
 

* `missingLinks2`: organized code. Maybe try to run tonight to see if model fit can be improved before we examine variable importance. Think of constructed features which may be important.

* `abundanceSDM`: added in simulations to examine limits of predictability given data constraints. Start running this code at home tonight. Edited text based on Alan's other comments.

* `numRecords`: spent too much time on this trivial non-project. Sheer curiosity.

* `centConserve`: pushed forward. 


### Tonight 

* `abundanceSDM`: sims sims sims

* `centConserve`: traits traits traits



## What should I be working on now? 

* `abundanceSDM`: edits to incorporate sims

* `centConserve`, `missingLinks2`, and `jobApps`
