## What have I worked on?
 
* `flatEarth`: manuscript formatting and submission. 
  
* `centConserve`: started exploration of a slightly different angle. It morphed into a completely different focus. Pushed along original project idea, but I'm getting odd results. Need to sit down and sketch out how I'm approaching the question; see if there's not a clearer way. 


* `reading`: thought a lot about the niche today, and did some associated reading. Not sure if anything is any clearer in my mind now. 





### Tonight 

* `rangeShape`: supplemental analyses and start to finalize responses







## What should I be working on now? 

* `missingLinks2`

* other stuff.
