## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: Single species model fitting. Getting to the root of these continued issues. Started it running. Should take a day or so. 

* `flatEarth`: submitted

* `professionalService`: article reviewed

* `srsSuccession`: pushed along some of the spatial stuff. 




### Tonight 

* `codeReview`: go through and make sure code is readable and correct for `popBuffering` and `rangeShape`

* `voniNetwork`



## What should I be working on now? 

* `codeReview`: `nodeProperties` and `hostRange`
