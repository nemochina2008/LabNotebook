## What have I worked on?
 
* `checkerBoard2`: polishing edits and sent to collaborators for feedback.

* `websiteUpdates`: added updated CV, removed some redundant code, and consolidated folders (no more `assets` AND `resources`, just `resources`). But kinda broke it, and now I want to overhaul everything. Terrible idea, but the plan is already in motion.

* `abundanceSDM`: polishing edits, and passed to Alan for comments

* `helmSize`: added host-parasite body size scaling relationships into supplement. Discussed them with Tim a bit as well. 

* `reading`






### Tonight 


* `spatExtinct`: start sketching out simulation code. 

* `website`: maybe play around with structure to make it more mobile-friendly. 

* `occurrence`: start formalizing ideas 







## What should I be working on now? 


* `professionalService`: review article

* `rangeShape`: be ready to re-submit as soon as Alan gives last minute comments

* `occurrence`, `spatExtinct`, others?
