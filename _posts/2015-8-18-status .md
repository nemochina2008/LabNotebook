## Random

* Sarah approached me with idea for collaboration. Keep this in the back of your mind with regards to data sources amenable for the project, whose focus is determining factors that contribute to parasite sharing at host level. I have some ideas on how to analyze these types of data, with the first being using co-occurrence networks, as the focus isn't on anything involving parasite traits, but instead is focused on the overlap in parasite communities among hosts. This, in my mind, is slightly different than looking at beta diversity, which is how parasite sharing is typically examined (I'm thinking of S. Locke's work, as well as the approaches taken by Krasnov and Poulin).
