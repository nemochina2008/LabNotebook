## What have I worked on?
 
* `jobs`: finished off research statement update. 
  
* `professionalService`: completed review

* `prsbProofs`: went through proofs of the _PRSB_ article. Pretty excited about it. 

* `abundanceSDM`: polished and passed to Alan for comments.

* `emergence`: tiny tweaks to code base and manuscript skeleton








### Tonight 

* `missingLinks2`: push along

* `whiteBoard`: take stock of current projects and make sure whiteboard is up-to-date.








## What should I be working on now? 

* `genTime`: because of flour switch, this can't start until 5 weeks from now. Maybe ending before Christmas, or may simply have to wait until the new year. 

* `helminthR`: code edits and whatever.

* `beetleProjects`: model fit code should be done shortly. Be ready to get `priorityEffects`, `checkerBoard`, and `dispersalTrait` simulations up and running.
