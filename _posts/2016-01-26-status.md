## What did I work on today?

* `class`: taught, and provided feedback on assignments

* `tempVar`:  Further refined, and annotated where I think the the individual-level experiment will fit in.

* `barrigaNetwork`: tossed around some more ideas. Project taking shape.

* `hostRange`: fixed issue with error rate being higher when more data is available to model. This analysis seems supplementary to the main analysis. Worked on formatting the `Rmd` document, and sketching out manuscript structure (subject to change).

* `nicheClass`: ugh. Why is coming up with exciting research ideas within a definite deadline so difficult?


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `nicheClass`: keep thinking and reading

* `hostRange`: keep pushing along manuscript structure.

* `nodeProperties`: Don't let this gather dust. Push the taxonomic info incorporation along.
