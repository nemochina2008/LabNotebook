## What did I work on today?

* `dissertation`: The last two chapters to send to the committee are `tempVar` and `thresholdDensity`, which aren't completely ready yet. Emailed committee with introduction chapter, and a note about the two other chapters.

* `helminthR`: re-submitted

## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `nicheClass`: develop protocol for project

* `tempVar`: writing and edits

* `hostRange`:  push along conceptually, and in terms of how the simulation bit relates to the empirical data (does using the Sevilleta data make sense for this application, or should be focusing on sparser, more broad-scale datasets?)
