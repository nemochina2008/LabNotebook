## What have I worked on?

* `rangeShape`: have a decent methods sketch. Figured out `cophenetic` issue. Currently use taxonomy as a proxy for phylogeny for trees and fish, since I couldn't find a well developed phylogeny for these groups. Hopefully this is okay. Wouldn't mind dropping this section from the manuscript, but I feel like a reviewer could argue evolutionary relationships could be more important than a trait basis.

* `rangeLean`: discussed project with Robin. Identified some ways forward.

* `CV`: updated CV with some submitted manuscripts.

* `logistics`: beetle stock maintenance and `priorityEffects` week 4 start.

* `atom`: figured out how to implement spellchecking for a bunch of different document formats. Cool beans.



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: continue editing introduction and methods sections
  * **impediments**: TRY data request hanging limits what I can proceed with on this project.

* `rangeLean`: examine if/how skewness changes over time for a subset of species. implement a statistical cutoff for including species whose ranges are sampled thoroughly _enough_.
  * **impediments**: protocol not fully formed. If skewness doesn't change over time, that's interesting, but thin. Need to work on a more developed protocol so this doesn't turn into a fishing expedition.

* `networkEWS`: Spatial Ricker model is not going to have a clean analytic bifurcation threshold. Is there a heuristic measure that can be used instead? Read and think on this. Once this cleared, the code is there. Perhaps sketch out potential manuscript flow.
  * **impediments**: Heuristic measure may not exist, or may simply be a dumb idea. Read some of the spatial EWS stuff done on lattices (e.g., some of Dakos' stuff).


### Longer-term

* `otherProjects`: some projects are back in my hands (or never left), including `flatEarth`, `thresholdDensity`, `nodeProperties`, `parasiteRange`,  and `macroHelminth`. Start tackling these in approximately the order they are written.

* `jobs`: selectively look around to see if there are other positions that would be a really good fit.
