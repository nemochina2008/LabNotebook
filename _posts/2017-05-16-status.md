## What have I worked on?
 
* `missingLinks`: proofs (last minute tweaks and such)
  
* `experimentIdeas`: competition in poor environemnts is tough because what I thought was an easy gradient (percent corn flour) is [not so clear-cut ](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1254/full). Oat flour is an option, as is some inedible filler. This gets at something different than stress gradient hypothesis though, as the underlying mechanism for the change interspecific effect is a change in cannabalism rate coupled with a change in growth rate. 

* `prevOcc`: ready to go once `priorityEffects` ends (2-3 weeks)

* `priorityEffects1`: solved model fitting issues on single species models. Now extending to two-species to sanity check before proceeding. Fingers crossed. 

* `srsSuccession`: pushed along a bit.

* `labLogistics`: project status updates and cleaned up my flash drive and Github repos. 




## What should I be working on now? 

* `priorityEffects1`: models running. Hopefully they are done tomorrow (this is unlikely though)

* `priorityEffects2`: push along. Will eventually have 7 gens of data. 

* `read`: Lots of projects off my desk. Time to read.
