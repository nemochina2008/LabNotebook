## What did I work on today?

* `zika`: got Rmd file up and running with some data formatting. Explored variables. Need to think of feature creation. AUC decent, but nothing special.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar`: have a good idea about population buffering I'd like to create protocol for.

* `nicheClass`: more species, more environmental variables, more developed manuscript skeleton
