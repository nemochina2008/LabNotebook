## What have I worked on?
 
* `dmv`: took most of the morning. womp womp.

 
* `checkerboard`: pushed along model dev and plotting code. It looks good, but I need to develop the analytical solution better. Currently, I'm just doing numerical simulations and making pretty plots.


### This weekend 

* `rangeShape`: Robin provided comments. They look great. Will work on this this weekend.

* `helmSize`: provide some structure of the main analyses of the manuscript and give collaborators a skeleton on which to build. Ignasio is plugging away at the introduction, and Alyssa has pushed along some of the methods. 

* `priorityEffects1`: ms dev (didn't do it last night)

* `graphDissim`: still unsure as to whether the metric can be applied to bipartite graphs. I have coded it up to work with unipartite projections of the bipartite graph, but I'm not super excited about running that code for the next 4-5 days. Perhaps this is a good time to utilize the `farm` cluster?


## What should I be working on now? 

* `priorityEffects1`: ms dev

* `ecologyGSS`: see some research talks at ecology symposium

* `checkerboard`: data entry and more model dev
