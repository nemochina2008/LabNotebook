## What have I worked on?

* `hostRange`: responded to Andrew's comments. Added conceptual figure. Sent back to collaborators for further review.

* `thresholdDensity`: worked on reviewer comments, and made some tweaks to supplemental analyses that should alleviate reviewer confusion and help strengthen main point of the manuscript. I know I'm supposed to be objective about my science, but reviewer comments that seem to stab at the conceptual or theoretical underpinnings of a project bother me...especially when I think the concern is pretty tangential to the main point of the manuscript. Rant over. They're good comments, and I appreciate the reviewers putting a solid amount of thought into them.


### Tonight

* `nodeProperties`: Reproduce all figures and tables based on the updated GMPD analysis


## What should I be working on now?

* `priorityEffects`: start plotting out data from first 3 replicates. It'll provide a test of analytical workflow.

* `rangeLean`: check on models.
