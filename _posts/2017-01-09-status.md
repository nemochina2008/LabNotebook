## What have I worked on?
 
* `checkerboard`: started it up! Exciting times. All undergrads on same page, and by tomorrow I'll have a super rough idea about dispersal dynamics.


* `thresholdDensity`: pushed along edits. Incorporated more detail and supplemental plots about K parameterization. Need to update text to clear about transient dynamics versus invasion threshold as described by epidemic simulations. On stable ground with respect to that business though, I think.


* `parasiteRange`: model runs finished and Colin produced some plots. Not really what I had thought the relationship would look like, but whatevs. Need to explore the data a bit further. Currently mostly in Colin's hands. 







  

### Back of mind

* `dietBreadth`:

* `specialization`:

* `helmSize`:




## What should I be working on now? 


* `popBuffering`: conceptual dev and intro restructuring

* `priorityEffects`: workflow for secondary analysis
