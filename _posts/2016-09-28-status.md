## What have I worked on?

* `labLogistics`: helped weigh some beetles. Experiment is running. _Real_ data to come next week.

* `rangeShape`: conceptual map made and substantial progress on discussion and methods sections

* `hostRange`: changed up a lot of stuff. Re-ran analyses using different accuracy measures, used the updated GMPD and excluded some of the troublesome host species. Added text about which species these were and why they were removed to the main text.

* `professionalService`: just thinking about how I hadn't had a review request in awhile. Just received two. woof.

* `nodeProperties`: worked on discussion section.



### Tonight

* `nodeProperties`: discussion text, and iron out some of the choices (accuracy metric, etc.)

* `thresholdDensity`: revisit and revise.




## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeLean`: is there anything even here?

* `professionalService`: review at least one before the weekend.
