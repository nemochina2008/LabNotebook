## What have I worked on?

* `dispersalTrait`: protocol for an experimental examining dispersal behavior in adult beetles. May be able to start on this next week at the earliest.

* `reading`: lots and lots and lots of reading.


## What should I be working on now?

* `hostRange`: results tweaks, discussion, and deciding what goes into supplement and what gets prime slots in the main text. Maybe thinking of target journal would inform some of those decisions?

* `tempVarInfection`: revisions
