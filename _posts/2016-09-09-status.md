## What have I worked on?

* `tempVarInfection`: resubmitted

* `networkEWS`: running on 100 randomly generated networks. Looking at preliminary results and starting to sharpen questions. Still lamenting my lack of access to the cluster. Should be done running by tomorrow.

* `rangeShape`: pushed further along. All analysis is at least sketched out. Some decent looking plots constructed. Need to sketch out manuscript flow, and determine which plots to push along.


## What should I be working on now?

* `parasiteRange`: continue to develop skeleton protocol

* `flatEarth`: John sent along comments. This is going to take careful editing, but the edits look manageable and positive.

* `priorityEffects`: set up analytical workflow for when data starts rolling in (8 weeks from now).
