## What have I worked on?
 
* `labLogistics`: morning interviews with 4 candidates for undergraduate researcher position(s) in lab. 

* `priorityEffects1`: ms dev. Some plotting. Some reading. Spent most of the day (6+ hours) on this.

  





### Tonight 

* `nodeProperties`: edit manuscript (waiting for feedback on next steps)

* `macroHelminth`: data bias section dev.

* `reading`: [this one](http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(16)30173-2?rss=yes) and maybe some others in the backlog






## What should I be working on now? 

* `priorityEffects1`: keep plugging away at manuscript and final plots. Be ready to show plots to Alan by tomorrow and Brett on Thursday to see what they think of direction.


* `checkerboard`: ms intro dev, data entry and validation (currently week 3 of gen 1)
