## What did I work on today?

* `FishParasite` edits, responses, and code formatting 

* `helminthR` dev, and manuscript edits (db is down, so not a huge amount of progress, but I did what I could)

* `DiseaseMacroecology` [Github organization](https://github.com/DiseaseMacroecology) setup (time to get projects organized and pushed along!)

* `resistanceCost` manuscript ready for re-submission

* Some `Threshold` work, but that needs to ramp up. It's good science, but damn is it frustrating.




## What should I be working on tomorrow

* Create `md` file for each `DiseaseMacroecology` project outlining the next steps forward. Use issues to track smaller stuff. Use the `md` documents for larger ideas and the conceptual way forward.

* `RH` made small change to network dissimilarity measure. Look it over, make sure you understand the consequences of the change, and then email the group back

* Review Oecologia manuscript

* `helminthR` edits if NHM db is up

*
