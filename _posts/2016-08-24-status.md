## What have I worked on?

* `rangeShape`: discussed project status with Robin. Some potentially promising ways forward. Preliminary explorations.
* `jobApp`: edited teaching statement.
* `fishParasite`: uploaded code to figshare to coincide with publication
* `e4`: proposal submitted
* `reading`:
* `priorityEffects`: sieved out adults. Getting the kinks worked out of experimental protocol, imaging, counting, etc.
* `RickerSpace`:started work on 2 species spatial Ricker model (project name will likely change)


## What should I be working on now?

* `RickerSpace`: continue development. It seems like it could be useful for several current lab projects.
