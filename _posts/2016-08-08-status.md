## What have I worked on?

* `srsMetacom`: final formatting, code ready, data and metadata formatted. Will submit final files when coauthors green light.

* `jobApp`: diversity statement and small edits to research/teaching statements

* `rangeShift`: played around with some data. I have a plan...ish.

* `reading`: This [beast of a paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/650265?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). Super cool stuff.




## What should I be working on now?


* `thresholdDensity`: edits

* `hostRange`: Charlie's edits

* `networkEWS`: revive this project, and get to a point where you could safely pitch to Alan.
