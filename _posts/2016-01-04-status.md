## What did I work on today?

* `parasiteExtinction`: Georeferencing tutorial so I can start helping the group

* `fishParasite`: Emailed Patrick for advice on incorporating taxonomic data. Most likely route is to calculate a taxonomic distance matrix, take `n` eigenvalues of that matrix, according to the same threshold I implement for the parasite community eigenvectors.

* `VerticaBD`: cleaned up code a bit for a guest lecture in a couple months. Need to go through a little refresher on the crazy `vSQL` code I wrote to use `Place`.

* `thresholdDensity`:  pushed model dev along, but it's slow-going



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `thresholdDensity`: model needs tweaks to make it agree with data. Otherwise, what's the point?

* `barrigaNetwork`: push some of this along

* `srsMetacom`: ask Chris about status of his work on it
