## What have I worked on?
 
* `zika`: talked with Michelle about my notes from last tonight's model exploration. 


* `checkerboard`: finalized experimental protocol. Fingers crossed that the stars align and I'm able to start it this week. It's currently slotted as a 2 week burst experiment, which I like the idea of, but nobody in the lab has done it, so hopefully we'll be able to handle the burstiness of the workload. 


* `popBuffering`: Easton is providing comments sometime this week. 

* `helmSize`: prettied up plots and sketched out manuscript flow.






## What should I be working on now? 


* `hostRange`: waiting to hear back from Shan about green light for submission. Submit soon.
