## What have I worked on?
 
* `nodeProperties`: submitted. Fingers crossed.
  
* `WOSfail`: pushed along text. Formatting it for _BioScience_ as a _Viewpoint_

* `thresholdDensity`: incorporated John's comments. Prepped code for submission.

* `flatEarth`: incorporated John's comments.



### Tonight


* `thresholdDensity`: run all code to make sure everything is entirely reproducible

* `run`: at like 10pm when it finally cools off.

* `graphDissim`: Moran! Moran! Moran!

* `RCN`: John brought up some ideas relating to `nodeProperties` and degree distributions. Worth sitting and thinking about.



## What should I be working on now? 


* `emergence`: protocol dev. Colin said he'd lay groundwork. Be ready to provide some substance to it.


* `centConserve`: push along and remove singleton parasites (or at least shunt them to the supplement)
