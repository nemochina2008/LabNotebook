## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeShape`: all edits done. Passed to coauthors. Will re-submit shortly
  
* `normalNiche`: spent way too long today working through silly `scp` mistakes while trying to pull files from remote server. 

* `priorityEffects`: fixed some code and started to re-fit models (code running yesterday choked on a tiny bug). Added bit of supplemental text. 

* `crisisAversion`: provided broad comments on manuscript draft.

* `beetleMentor`: met with undergrad today to discuss potential projects in the beetle system. Think I have an idea for his interests, and gave him a protocol I wrote previously to get his experimental design mind working. Will meet with him again when I return from backpacking, and we can start sketching out some more concrete ideas.



### Tonight 

* `beetleMentor`: pass 2-3 papers along. 

* `metacom`: submit update to CRAN

* `rangeShape`: resubmit




## What should I be working on now? 

* `rangeLean`: re-analyze data using new skew measure. Re-make plots. Robin will add skew measure calculation to text. Time to toss this manuscript on Overleaf or continue using Github workflow?

* `backpacking`: 10 days in King's Canyon area, 5 nights in backcountry. At least 1 or 2 trail runs. Pretty stoked.
