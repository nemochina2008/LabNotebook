## What have I worked on?

 * `beetleSkype`: discussed upcoming experiments and existing data with Brett, Alan, and Geoff. Some discussion of my idea for a first experiment.

* `hastings`: protocol for first experiment as a beetle guy.

* `netDissim`: pushed my idea along, and came up with some interesting results. Passed along to collaborators to see what they think.

* `thresholdDensity`: finishing touches, and passed along to collabs for final approval.

* `reading`: mainly beetle stuff. Trying to get an idea of the system, especially in terms of species interactions.

* `srsMetacom`: contacted one data source, which should be really great. Looking forward to making this manuscript stronger.


## What should I be working on now?

* `reading`

* `professionalService`: review one of the articles.

* `srsMetacom`: keep pushing along analysis of other data sources

* `nodeProperties`: make sure it's in a good place. Not sure what needs to be done on this from my end.

* `hostRange`: needs discussion work, and some sharpening of focus.

* `thresholdDensity`: submit if you hear from collabs
