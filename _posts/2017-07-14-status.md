## What have I worked on?
 

* `normalNiche`: pushed along protocol and a bit of what will turn into an introduction. Tapped collaborators to check it out. Discussed some of the nuances of the project. 
  
* `JacobSeminar`: Jacob Moore gave his exit seminar. It was really interesting

* `rangeShape`: some table formatting and supplemental text tweaks



### Tonight 

* `rangeShape`: fix scraping bullshit. More supplemental tweaks and polishes. 

* I refuse to believe that spatial autocorrelation matters when the full range of environmental conditions a species could occupy is well-sampled. I probably could be convinced. I'll read up on this tonight, and maybe run some simulations.




## What should I be working on now? 

* `SMB`: Society for Mathematical Biology conference next week in Salt Lake City. Should be fun times. Reminder to self: submit final files for `hostRange` before leaving. 

* `centConserve`: follow up on offshoot project idea, and maybe original project idea as well.

* ``:
