## What have I worked on?

* `priorityEffects`: logistics and experimental setup
* `rangeShape`: some data formatted and ready to go. Worked today on fitting data with `nls`. Need to talk to Robin to guide some of the choice of models to fit.
* `thresholdDensity`: discussing some points with coauthors.
* `reading`:
* Discussed some projects and preliminary findings with Colin. We'll hopefully be pushing along some parasite projects in the coming months, but are still sketching out interesting questions.
* `e4`: application completed. Send in before Sept 1.
* `jobApp`: incorporated some of Marissa's edits


## What should I be working on now?

* `jobApp`: incorporate the rest of Marissa's suggestions
