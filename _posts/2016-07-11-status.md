## What have I worked on?


* `priorityEffects`: stochastic two species Ricker ready to rock and roll.
* `deterioratingEnv`: same as above with a few modifications.
* `popBuffering`: pushed it along a bit, but need to see if John buys the path I'm taking.
* `nicheClass`: some light edits. Trying to make it a bit sharper and clearer.




## What should I be working on now?

* `cannibal`: Keep trudging along. Maybe talk to Alan about my approach soon-ish.
* `nodeProperties`: Charlie made some comments that need to be incorporated/addressed.
