## What did I work on today?

* `labNotebook`: wrote a `Python` script to create blog post entry skeletons, and an associated `makefile` that can create posts (`make post`) and add/commit/push changes to github (`make github`). I know it's probably one of the most inelegant ways to serve up blog posts, but I'm happy with it. Don't judge me.

* `nodeProperties`: updated to incorporate Patrick's methods changes.

* `thresholdDensity`: jotted down quick blurb for `meetingWithJohn`

* `srsMetacom`: incorporated and modified Marcus' methods section additions

* `tempVar`: Entered a borderline obscene amount of data.

* `meetingWithJohn`:  We're going to sit and think on my R0 idea. I think it's genius. <i class="fa fa-wrench"></i>


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar`: cement some modeling protocols to dive into those data. Questions on the table involve the role of a variable environment on population synchrony, extinction time distro, resilience, etc. Let's have some fun.

* `parasiteExtinction`: Working with a group on some parasite extinction stuff. Need to do a bit of grunt work and georeference some host-parasite interactions.
