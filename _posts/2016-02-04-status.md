## What did I work on today?

* `thresholdDensity`: study is now completely reproducible. Still a tiny bit of code annotating to do, but all analysis is presented in decently readable and well-structured format. Final plots done. Writing underway.

* `srsMetacom`: pushed along and further formatted.

* `meetingWithJohn`
  * `tempVar`: write up summary of the two different approaches to calculating infection intensity (also called "how I almost decided to switch protocol in mid-experiment, but then decided that what I had planned was the _best_ route")
  * `srsMetacom`: co-editing the introduction immensely helpful. Incorporate the changes into the master, and dwell on changes made (`diff` that shit and study it)

*  `teach`: Good class. Talkative and engaged. Covered fungi and arthropods today. Lab assessment next week.

* `read`: 3 papers for lab, including [this awesome paper](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/content/royprsb/283/1824/20152702.full.pdf) that I read as a pre-print awhile ago

## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `labMeeting`:

* `thresholdDensity`: writing and editing

* `srsMetacom`: writing and editing

* `tempVar`: experimental running


## late night or weekend

### (because Julie is in the field)

* `fishParasite`: push along the text and create final plots (should host tax even go in the paper, or should I shunt it to the supplement? )

* `georeference`: finish it off.

* `thresholdDensity`: tighten up language, and edit results, discussion, and supplement in order to reflect new findings
