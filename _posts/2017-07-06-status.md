## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeShape`: more detailed responses to minor edits, commented approaches for larger edits (to be filled in with more detail at a later time). 


* `macroHelminth`: pushed along some of the text. Mainly polishing and organizing before I email collaborators. 


* `read`: a few good articles ((example)[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12601/full])







### Tonight

* `helminthR`: scrape to get citation counts for all host-parasite associations. Going to take awhile. 

* `centConserve`: look at it. It's been awhile, and I still think it has potential.




 



  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `SMBtalk`: put together some slides. Last talk I gave was dissertation defense. hehe.

* ``:
