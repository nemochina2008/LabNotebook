## What have I worked on?
 
* `professionalService`: accepted review request. Read through it once and took some preliminary notes. 

* `macroHelminth`: edits to introduction. Passed SAR stuff along to Colin. 

* `colin`: discussed a few helminth projects.

* `helminthR`: a bit more dev on some citation information scraping, but it's pretty slow going and a bit tougher than seems worthwhile. 







## What should I be working on now? 

* `helmSize`: tap collaborators to see where they are at with discussion. 

* `rangeShape`: push this forward

* `missingLinks2`: push this forward

* `professionalService`: complete review
