## What have I worked on?

* `labMeetings`: Baskett and Hastings lab meetings

* `flatEarth`: e-mailed Hijmans about feedback on this work.

* `missingLinks`: pushed along final text polishing and e-mailed John.

* `rangeShape`: pushed TRY data analysis and plotting along. Now it's just a matter of writing and polishing. Pushed a bunch of this along, and have tried to make sure that the _meta-narrative_ iterates the main findings. John would be proud, even though typing the word _meta-narrative_ makes me cringe a bit. Prettied up the main text figures.



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: polish methods section with data size specifics etc. Push along supplement.

* `priorityEffects`: get all data entered and validated. create new data sheets for generation 3. sit down and think about fitting Ricker model to the data, and about what figures would best demonstrate the demographic variance (n by n+1 for each species with points colored by competitor density)

* `extinctionChapter`: read.

* `macroHelminth`: RCN members suggested a fair amount of changes. Start incorporating these.

* `professionalService`: finish review and send it in.
