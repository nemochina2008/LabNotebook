## What did I work on today?

* `srsMetacom`: writing and plotting
Fleshing out the methods and results. 

* Teaching lab 12-5p

* Ran with Drew

* Read student research proposals, comments done. (schedule individual conferences next week; poll students to see ideal 2-3 hour block so I can knock them all out at once)




## What should I be working on tomorrow?

* `srsMetacom`: keep plugging away. 

* `resistanceCosts`: need to get on these edits while still fresh

* `globalHelminth`: global distribution of helminths paper 
Solid skeleton, and clear way forward. Meeting with Paola next week to discuss. Have something solid in hand for that meeting.




## Soon!

* `VerticaBd`: Writing before handing to John for inspection

* `Threshold`: John suggested some reading. Read some stuff.
