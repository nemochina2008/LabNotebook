## What have I worked on?
 
* `thresholdDensity`: comments responded to, a variety of new figures made, and sent along to collaborators to get input before I charge ahead. I'll be happy when this is off my desk tbh.


* `popBuffering`: spruced up figures. added the beginnings of a conceptual paragraph before thesis. tried better to sharpen main findings and their theoretical basis (needs lots more dev on this front). 


  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `nodeProperties`: edits and additions proposed by John.

* `checkerboard`: Flour is ready. Label and prep patches. 

* `popBuffering`: keep pushing along slowly.
