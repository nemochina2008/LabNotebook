## What have I worked on?

* `labLogistics`: did some dishes. Bad headache for most of the morning made reading a bit tough. 
 
* `networkEWS`: ran a bunch of code overnight, and the results are looking promising. Needs a bit more structure though. 

* `dietBreadth`: messed around with some code to calculate host phylogenetic and functional diversity for a given parasite species. A recent PNAS paper got me thinking about it. Will push along more if I have time. 

* `reading`: [Poisot _et al._ pre-print](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/07/079780)

* `ideas`: pitched an idea to Alyssa. It could be dumb. 


* `meetingWithAlan`: went well. Focus on `priorityEffects` in the coming weeks, and start implementing some changes in the beetle lab per our discussion. 




## What should I be working on now? 


* `labLogistics`: address some of the things Alan and I talked about today.

 
* `priorityEffects`: do it.
