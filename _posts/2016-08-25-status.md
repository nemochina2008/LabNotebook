## What have I worked on?

* `RickerSpace`: still not a good name, but I've developed a two species dynamical model. Setting the distribution of habitat patches in the metacommunity as a 2 dimensional landscape with species with range convergence at the center, we can observe how species interactions can cause range limits. Tight.

* `labShopping`: Need to pick up a few things in preparation for experiment starting next week. Dry run this week revealed some _foibles_ to say the least. Nothing a bit of brainstorming with the awesome team of undergrads couldn't solve.

* `reading`: some spatial range limit stuff, but also some general interest reads ([1](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/08/23/070789.full.pdf), [2](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-phyto-080615-095959), [3](https://peerj.com/articles/2367/?utm_source=summary_email_publication&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=connection), [4](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matias_Arim/publication/272525228_Disentangling_the_effects_of_local_and_regional_processes_on_biodiversity_patterns_through_taxon-contingent_metacommunity_network_analysis/links/54ebb97c0cf2a030519498a0.pdf))



## What should I be working on now?

* `RickerSpace`: firm up some protocols around this model. There are a lot of great questions that this can be used to address. I'd like to do something incorporating the findings of a recent _Theoretical Ecology_ paper demonstrating that the Ricker converges to a Levin's model.

* `priorityEffects`: bring team together to discuss experimental protocol, logistics of counting, and the fine-grained details of everything. Everyone needs to be on the same page.
