## What have I worked on?
 
* `hostRange`: accepted for publication in _PRSB_. Final touches to manuscript and figshare repo. Hooray!

* `reading`: some classics like [Ricker](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/f54-039), and some newer ones like [Oksanen](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0304380002001904/1-s2.0-S0304380002001904-main.pdf?_tid=de3ded02-6730-11e7-b233-00000aab0f01&acdnat=1499884704_d439c939b5a4fa038ccc4623874e2368) and [Dvorsky](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.13001/full) with some metapopulation [stuff](http://izt.ciens.ucv.ve/ecologia/Archivos/ECO_POB%202011/ECOPO2_2011/Poethke%20et%20al%202011.pdf) thrown in.


* `rangeShape`: Plots made. Supplemental text and analyses addressing reviewer concerns added. Talking with Alan about the revisions tomorrow. Should be able to submit revised version within a week or so. Need to make a couple more supplemental plots and 2 tables (to fully address reviewer concerns in the supplement).







### Tonight


* `rangeShape`: make the plots and tables for tomorrow. Get this thing ready to ship. 

* `reading`: new Gilarranz paper in _Science_







## What should I be working on now? 


* `meetingWithAlan`: talk about `rangeShape` edits, new experiments, status of `priorityEffects`, idea about scramble competition, etc. 


* other stuff?
