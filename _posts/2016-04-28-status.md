## What did I work on today?

 I let this fall by the wayside again. My bad. Since my last entry, I have worked on the following projects:

* `dissertation`: finalized and submitted. It's beautiful and beyond reproach. It will be bound in gold, and never read by anyone.

* `tempVar`: data entered, analyzed, and plotted. Pushed manuscript text along for `infection` component. As far as `population` component, I have sketched out 3 protocols for potential projects relating to the effect of fluctuating environments on extinction time distro, speed to population collapse, and host demography that could lead to population-level buffering effects. This will be a main push of mine in the coming months.

* `srsMetacom`: manuscript examining zooplankton metacommunity structure in ephemeral wetlands submitted for publication. Best of luck to that manuscript through the meat grinder of peer review.

* `hostRange`: added a new element per the suggestion of a coauthor. Starting to piece together the final figures and the overall story. RCN meeting in early May should hopefully solidify some directions.

* `zika`: pushed along this project. Largely in Michelle's hands currently.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar`: population protocols and code. Focus on extinction distro aspect for now.

* `nicheClass`: create hexbin plots. Edit text based on discussion with John.
