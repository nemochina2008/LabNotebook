## What have I worked on?

* _UC Davis_ library ordered  _The Theory of Ecological Communities_ 2 days before me requesting. That means it should get here even faster!

* `networkEWS`: thinking/reading/protocol writing. Pushed along a solid amount.
* `priorityEffects`: second week counting was today, and everything went smoothly.




## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: data munging
* `priorityEffects`: analytical workflow and introduction
