## What did I work on for the past 2 days?

* `srsMetacom`: writing and plotting
Solid correlation plot produced. Tables pretty must done. Time to start fleshing out the methods and results. 

* `globalHelminth`: global distribution of helminths paper 
Solid skeleton, and clear way forward. Meeting with Paola next week to discuss. Have something solid in hand for that meeting.

* Bob Paine seminar on food webs

* Meeting with Rachel to talk about her salt marsh - mangrove work 
  * community composition across a gradient of salt marsh to mangrove habitat
  * general controls of diversit (space versus environment)
  * high v. low marsh? Or is it safe to combine these data for comparison to mangrove?
  * canopy cover -- lower chlorophyll -- infaunal community shift 
  * hard substrate availability -- epifanual community shift
  




## What should I be working on tomorrow?

+ **morning**: push `srsMetacom` along. If time permits, start plugging away at `resistanceCosts` edits

+ Teaching lab 12-5p

+ **evening**: run with Drew. If energy permits, read through student research project proposals, and comment on them (comment on smaller issues on the protocol, and address larger conceptual shortcomings during group conferences)






## Soon!

* `VerticaBd`: Writing before handing to John for inspection

* `Threshold`: John suggested some reading. Read some stuff.

* `resistanceCosts`: edits (seem straightforward, but be sure to address them all)
