## What have I worked on?

* Over the weekend, I
  * reviewed an article
  * made pretty diversity map for `macroHelminth`
  * `nodeProperties`: pushed along. All figures recreated and reproducible, and manuscript text is now updated. Small tweaks needed before sending off to coauthors.


* `rangeLean`: discussed project status with Alan and Robin. Outlined path forward on modeling front, and did some minor text edits. Plenty of manuscript dev to do, but want to wait until modeling section is a bit more formalized. Pushed along manuscript text, and a did a bunch of reading on climate velocity, spatial abundance distros, and range limits ([a representative example](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.014))

* `spatialProjects`: came up with a solid protocol for a project to do after Ty's `AME` experiment is finished.




### Tonight

* `nodeProperties`: polish text and send off to coauthors. Sit and think about target journals and timeline around submission

* `Vellend`: read 1-2 chapters




## What should I be working on now?

* `dataEntry`: Help the undergrad team by contributing to data entry and validation.

* `rangeShape`: TRY data release should be later this week, so get ready to push this project along substantially.

* `rangeLean`: continue to shore up introduction flow, and talk to Robin about model dev.
