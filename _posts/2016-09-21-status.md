## What have I worked on?

* `reading`: some spatial early warning signal stuff (e.g., [Kefi](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092097)), and some oddball stuff that interested me enough to print out.

* `rangeShape`: tweaks to manuscript text. Strengthened trait basis argument. Waiting on TRY request. Pushed forward some spatial plotting for supplement and main text. Tweaking some of the bird observations to remove islands, as they are likely not representative of the continuous range of a species. This has proven to be a giant pain, with plenty of `grep`-ing and `filter`-ing. Tried using country as a mask, doesn't work when political unit has mainland and island.

* `rangeLean`: incorporated skewness measure over time and across latitude. Preliminary scan looks pretty messy. Perhaps either the data aren't all that skewed, or breaking it down by time or latitude is confounding the pattern.

* `networkEWS`: played around with the code some more. Thought of simulation based indicators of collapse. Somewhat arbitrary. Maybe get John's advice about this problem at some point soon? Some more preliminary simulations currently running.


### Tonight

* `parasiteRange`: play around with data. Outline some issues that need to be addressed and track on repo
* `flatEarth`: edit text to be beautiful.


## What should I be working on now?

* `networkEWS`: check on simulations. Email John about this?
* `rangeShape`: supplemental mapping and main text conceptual figure.
