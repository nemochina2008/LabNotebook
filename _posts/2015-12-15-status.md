## What did I work on today?

* `hostRange`: Host-parasite interaction simulations completed, and run along two major gradients; the number of interactions of a given parasite (i.e., number of times the parasite was found), and the host breadth of the parasite (number host species infected). The simulation study part of this paper tests accuracy of host range estimators along the two gradients. The empirical portion will apply the estimation, report the results, and then plot each parasites location in the phase space of the two gradients. This will address both when these estimators may provide accurate results, and perhaps get at why the estimates for host breadth are kind of garbage-y. It sure did. Plots look tight. A bit more work, then pass along to collaborators.  


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `netDissim`: fix code to work with igraph, and to define dissim measures based on [Poisot (2012 )](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12002/abstract)
