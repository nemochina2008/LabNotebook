## What have I worked on?
 
* `normalNiche`: started sketching out code for data cleaning. Will push along more this evening. 

* `coffee`: drank coffee and discussed an idea with Frank and Alan

* `genTime`: protocol ready to go, but will have to wait until late September or early October to begin. Data sheets made. Hopefully will have flour garbage figured out by that time. 

* `emergence`: fixed some of the plotting layout stuff. Will push forward analysis tonight

* `rangeShape`: met with Alan to discuss edits. Re-submitted, then noticed one figure has a slightly incorrect color scheme. I am dumb. Will correct soon.




### Tonight 

* `run`

* `easton`: meeting with Easton to discuss comments on his manuscript. 

  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `centConserve`: katz centrality

* `emergence`: fix plotting, feature selection, first pass feature agnostic approaches
