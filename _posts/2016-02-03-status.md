## What did I work on today?

* `tempVar`: starting to heat up. a bit of mortality early on, but that's inherent in working with little _Daphnia_ monsters.

* `thresholdDensity`: Read the manuscript, think about final plots, add stochastic model section, clean/annotate code better to place in supplement.



## What should I be working on tomorrow

*  `teach`

* `thresholdDensity`: paste it all together.


## Horizon

* `fishParasite`: have analysis done. Push along plotting and text.

* `macroHelminth`: incorporate changes as they come in from collabs

* `georeference`:  finish this off!
