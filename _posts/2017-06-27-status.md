## What have I worked on?
 
* `colin`: pushed forward a couple of projects, and talked way too much about the definition of the parasite niche. 

* `missingLinks2`: Slack channel formed. Have data. Set up repo. 

* `nicheView`: Collaboration with Colin. Read a bit for it, but need to read more before I can really contribute. 

* `rangeShape`: positive reviews. I believe all reviewer comments can be addressed. Started to go through the reviews in more detail, set up responses file, and addressed most of the minor comments.






### Tonight

* `macroHelminth`: make sure using data that makes sense. Get Colin SAR slopes

* `chytrid`: send Colin the paper. 

* `rangeShape`: respond to reviewers




  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `rangeShape`: add supplemental analyses to restrict species more strongly, perhaps try to find independent estimates of distribution for species (pull GBIF data), 

* `missingLinks2`: push along analysis and sketch out methods with goals (mini-protocol)
