## What have I worked on?
 
* `nodeProperties`: gave it a solid read-through and drafted cover letter. 
  
* `graphDissim`: pushed along. Passed to Tim with a question.

* `flourTest`: firmed up protocol and created data sheets. Unlikely that we'll have enough beetles to start this until 3 weeks from now. 

* `labStuff`: finals week has made the lab a bit of a ghost town. Helped make patches and count beetles together. Best of luck to the team on their finals. 


* `checkerBoard2`: pushed forward. Found some data entry garbage that needed to be fixed. Updated plots and switched around figure 1 to make it more data rich. 



### Tonight 

* `backUp`: set up `restic` or perhaps just mess with `rsync` on external HD at home to backup USB drive. 




## What should I be working on now? 


* `checkerBoard2`: finishing touches before sharing with collabs

* `genTime`: develop protocol
