## What have I worked on?

* `popBuffering`: project in decent shape. Passed around to lab to get their opinions on it. Also an attempt to promote a more collaborative/interactive lab culture (which is absolutely present).


* `priorityEffects`: sketched out more of the introductory text, and worked on developing methods section.



* `popEcolLecture`: finalized notes, and think I have a decent understanding of the material, but it's definitely outside my wheelhouse (which allows me to learn it, so that's cool)



## What should I be working on now?

* `rcnStuff`: GMPD data updated and sent out, so re-run `nodeProperties` and `hostRange` analyses to prep these papers for submission.
