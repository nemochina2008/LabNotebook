## What have I worked on?

* `dispersalTrait`: pushed along. Manuscript on Overleaf with updated figures. Pushed along methods dev, and outlined results. Passed to Brett for his initial opinion about stats and structure.

* `metacom`: fixed a small bug. 

* `labProject`: wrote more words



### Tonight

* `graphDissim`: pushed along the text a bit.

* `centConserve`: protocol dev and analytic framework stage (if that)




## What should I be working on now? 

* `checkerboard`: data entry and analytic framework
* `priorityEffects2`: analytic skeleton
* `experimentIdeas`: prevOcc is solid, but I think we might be able to start two experiments relatively soon (within 10 weeks).



* `graphDissim`: own time fun time.
* `centConserve`: protocol dev and analytic framework stage (if that)
* `helmSize`: tap collaborators after sketching out discussion skeleton
