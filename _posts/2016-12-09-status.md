## What have I worked on?
 
* `esaDisease`: planning meeting in the morning prompted some small changes to website structure. 

* `priorityEffects`: wrote code for maximum likelihood fitting for the full set of models, and associated nll functions. However, I'm not sure if I did everything correctly. Need to continue to run tests on the code to make sure it's doing what it should be doing. This took the majority of the day. Oof. 

* `helmsize`: Alyssa liked the project idea, and created a repo. I played around with the data a bit, but haven't done much more than play around and write a couple of small support functions. 

* `dispersalTrait`: edited protocol. It's ready to go. Got paint pen in and I have high hopes it'll work for marking beetles. If it does, we're in business to start this experiment in early-mid January. 


  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `professionalService`: review article 

* `helmsize`: push along 

* `thresholdDensity`: work on responses to reviewers and editor. Be clear about where the changes are (line numbers). 

* `labLogistics`: Census number of patches in prep for spatial experiment in early January. Wash as many dishes as you can. 

* `priorityEffects`: get data ready to be offered to the maximum likelihood gods.
