## What did I work on today?

* Proctored Biol 1103 exam in the morning

* `srsMetacom`: pushed along some manuscript text, and explored some of the null model foibles.



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `insectDisease`: need to just knock the descriptive part out, then maybe brainstorm how these data can be used. 


* `globalHelminth`: Needs some writing love. Most of the plots are already made. Now I just need to weave that narrative (i.e. the hard part).
