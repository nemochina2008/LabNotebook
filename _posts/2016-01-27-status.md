## What did I work on today?

 * `fishParasite`: Calculated taxonomic distance eigenvectors. Code ready to run. Will start running analysis on home workstation tonight. Code should take approximately 30 hours to finish running.

 * `hostRange`: still finding that species richness estimators are more accurate when trained on smaller amounts of data. Makes no sense. Potential bug...or it's just that the number of singletons increases as a function of more data, altering estimator performance. Tried out two different error measures to make sure it wasn't error metric (_running currently_)

 * `nicheClass`: I'm going to pitch a far-flung project looking at niche overlap in parasite species...because why not? Will work on idea dev tonight, and protocol tomorrow.

* `macroHelminth`: Corresponded with other authors on the project. Shan's plot looks solid.

* `tempVar`: more experimental prep (hardwater media creation, neonate farming, tube washing, etc.)







## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `nicheClass`: dev protocol for project

* `macroHelminth`: add a bit more meat to introduction, and provide a clearer manuscript skeleton.
