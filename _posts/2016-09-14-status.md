## What have I worked on?

* `rangeShape`: calculated environmental distance at species niche centers. Pushed forward the phylogeny component, and wrote a decent chunk of the introduction.

* `networkEWS`: pushed along plotting and analysis.

* `reading`

* `labLogistics`: ordered more lab tape and flour

* `flatEarth`: incorporated some more of John's edits


## What should I be working on now?

* `beetleTeam`: Skype meeting to discuss logistics

* `rangeShape`: keep pushing it along

* `rangeLean`: time to use data.table or ff to cram some decently sized data into R
