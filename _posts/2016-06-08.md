## What have I worked on?

* Made a 4 day road trip to California to start a postdoc with Alan Hastings. Today is my first day in the office. Mainly going through all the logistics (e.g., ID card, health insurance, blah blah).  After that comes reading. Hoping to hit the ground running.

* `srsMetacom`: revisions requested. Really positive and solid reviews, so I am hopeful.

* `fishParasite`: revisions requested. Pretty positive reviews, though some light stabs at the conceptual underpinnings (never a good thing). Should be easy enough to incorporate edits. No changes to analysis suggested, but just some additional text and some expanded intro and discussion.

* `reading`: a bit of Taylor's law reading.

* `zika`: skimmed the current draft, but will wait until Barbara and others comment on the manuscript before I toss my 2 cents into it.


## What should I be working on now?

* re-read Hastings grant proposal and other relevant literature.

* start plugging away at manuscript revisions for `srsMetacom` and `fishParasite`

* `thresholdDensity`: _Proc B_ passed on it, but John believes (and I hope) that _Am Nat_ may be a good place for this study. Need to change out `bst` files, and do a bit of reformatting for _Am Nat_ before submission.
