## What did I work on today?

* `nicheClass`: class project aspect done. Sent most recent draft to John.

* `nodeProperties`: re-ran analyses removing aquatic carnivores (Barbara seemed to think the inclusion of those guys would muddy the trait profiles). All plots are updated, and went through and incorporated the majority of Barbara's text edits.

* `RCN`: meeting this Thursday - Saturday. Started to piece together quick update presentation for the group.

* `grading`: grades due May 5, and I still need to finish grading some of the final research articles. oof.



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar`: John provided comments. Incorporate them all.

* `RCN prep`: re-familiarize and push `hostRange`, `nodeProperties`, and `macroHelminth` along.
