## What have I worked on?
 
* `dispersalTrait`: re-wrote thesis paragraph and other small tweaks to text. 

* `reading`: [this one](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/03/06/114330.full.pdf), and  Dalsgaard _et al._ 2017 _Ecography_ paper on latitudinal specialization gradients (that's a rabbit hole comparable to the diversity-stability debate! Oof.)

* `helmSize`: skeleton of discussion. Bit of data exploration tonight if time permits.

* `checkerboard`: entered all the data in. Woof. 

* `labMeeting`: discussed lab project. 

* `ecolSeminar`: Rachel Vanette on "Microbial community assembly and function in plant-pollinator interactions"


### Tonight 

* `arc`: run run lift.

* `graphDissim`: make sure all the data are ready before you pull anybody else in on this. 




  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `checkerboard`: EDA and analytic skeleton

* `experimentIdeas`: think of them.

* `rangeShape`: prep cover letter and recommended reviewers.

* `helmSize`: email collaborators.
