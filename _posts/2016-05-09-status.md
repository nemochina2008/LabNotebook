## What did I work on today?

* `nodeProperties`: all on the Github issue tracker (sorry, private repo for now). knocked them all out today.


* `hostRange`: Shan didn't have many comments, but we did discuss pushing the paper in some new directions dealing with the empirical range prediction, and getting a tighter comparison to the simulations. Did some thinking about this. Will push along tomorrow.



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `hostRange`:  do science.

* `tempVar`: population-level protocols and analyses
