## What have I worked on?
 
* `abundanceSDM`: fixed a bug and am re-running models, but now I'm self-conscious that I don't have adequate data. Wrote some code to perhaps drag in some more species.

* `centConserve`: wisely pulled Poisot into this one. Wrote some words and did some thinking. Interested to see what he has to say about the general problem and my current approach. 

* `priorityEffects1`: polished text. It's ready to go once supplemental data rolls in.

* `dispersalTrait`: edits to text in preparation of data supplement 







### Tonight 

* `abundanceSDM`: make sure all models are run with updated code, and then consider diving into other data streams





  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `checkerBoard`: make edits to text in preparation of data supplement 

* `priorityEffects2`: doesn't rely on supplemental data. pushed data loading and cleaning scripts forward.
