## What have I worked on?

* Didn't get `nodeProperties` polished off last night, but did pretty up code, and make sure that it's running bug-free.

* `rangeLean`: added bit about species-specific changes in asymmetry over time. Nothing really there, but a good supplement figure.

* `logistics`: updated CV and website with review history and recent _Ecology and Evolution_ publication

* `spatialExperiments`: finalized `prevOcc` protocol and sent to Alan for comments

* `reading`: [fun](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12350/abstract) and some more [fun](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00643.x/full)


### Tonight

* `dataEntry`: maybe some dishes too. A bit of lab work tends to help me think big picture.


## What should I be working on now?

* `priorityEffects`: gen 2 week 3. Make sure data are entered, and we're set on supplies and such.

* `rangeLean`: pass asymmetry values and model specifics to Robin

* `teary`: skim the _Am Nat_ papers Alan sent around

* `nodeProperties`: pass to collaborators after triple-checking manuscript flow and updates to tables and figures (double check host family results in the results section).
