## What have I worked on?

 I've let this go again. While my computer is getting set up at the new office, I don't have `make`, and that's my paltry excuse for not posting (I use `make` to generate post skeletons). I'll be better about it soon. For now, here's a mega-update of my progress since the last update.

* `srsMetacom`: some data formatting and initial analysis to supplement the existing data in the manuscript.

* `fishParasite`: responded to reviewers concerns, and resubmitted. Keeping fingers crossed, and am hopeful. 

* `hastings`: getting familar with the system (lots of reading old papers), and coming up with some questions to cut my teeth on while the current experiment finishes up. Thinking of non-spatial experiment, and have a decent one in mind (but we'll see what Brett and Alan have to say).

* `hostRange`: incorporated Charlie's comments, and am working on developing one aspect further. Ran into a weird finding that I need to make sure is not simply a bug.

* `nodeProperties`: looking solid (minus the lack of discussion section). Excited to continue to push this along, and eventually see how it's received (assuming somebody will publish it)

* `thresholdDensity`: formatted and ready to jump back into the stochastic world of peer review. May luck ever be in blah blah blah blah.

* `tempVar`: Pursuing an interesting angle, with the help of Spencer Hall, who responds quickly to email and is happy to share data. I'm a fan.


## What should I be working on now?

* `hastings`: Skype call tomorrow to discuss logistics. Hopefully will touch on some of the underlying assumptions of multi-species interactions in this system (what does competition _really_ even mean ... man?)

* `thresholdDensity`: submit

* `netDissim`: thought of an interesting approach...would like to pursue it if I have time.



## This weekend

* `professionalService`: review-fest. agreed to review two papers. Both seem _super_ interesting, so I'm excited to dig in.
