## What have I worked on?

* Made a 4 day road trip to California to start a postdoc with Alan Hastings. This week is my first day in the office. Mainly going through all the logistics (e.g., ID card, health insurance, blah blah).  After that comes reading. Hoping to hit the ground running, starting with a meeting with Alan on Monday.

* `srsMetacom`: revisions requested. Really positive and solid reviews, so I am hopeful. Have been working on finding more datasets, as the reviewers suggested an expanded analysis.

* `fishParasite`: revisions requested. Pretty positive reviews, though some light stabs at the conceptual underpinnings (never a good thing). Should be easy enough to incorporate edits. No changes to analysis suggested, but just some additional text and some expanded intro and discussion. I've responded to reviewers, and edited manuscript text. Manuscript is currently in collaborators hands (Andrew and John) to comment before resubmission.

* `reading`: a bit of Taylor's law reading, and some spatial population dynamics stuff. A bit of beetle research as well to get a bit more familiar with the system. Also re-read grant Alan's funded proposal.

* `zika`: skimmed the current draft, but will wait until Barbara and others comment on the manuscript before I toss my 2 cents into it.


## What should I be working on now?

* `thresholdDensity`: _Proc B_ passed on it, but John believes (and I hope) that _Am Nat_ may be a good place for this study. Need to change out `bst` files, and do a bit of reformatting and minor edits before _Am Nat_ submission.
