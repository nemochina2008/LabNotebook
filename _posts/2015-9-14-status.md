## What did I work on today?

* Met with Gary Mittelbach (enjoyable chat with a really bright guy)

* Discussed `parasiteExtinction` project with Colin Carlson (exciting stuff!)

* `Competition` paper accepted in Ecology. yay! <i class="fa fa-certificate" style="color:gold"> </i>

* `srsMetacom` code is running. In the meantime, worked on structure of introduction and methods

* `parasiteR` software note edits. 



## What should I be working on tomorrow?

* Make sure figures and everything are _perfect_ for `Competition` work

* Push other `globalHelminth` projects along (consider pitching these data as a lab project)

* Threshold host density work (frustrating, but there's a solution I'm just missing)


### Small logistics

* Talk to Brian about cluster stuffs

* Finalize rubric for lab exam

* Subset `globalHelminth` and send along to work.

### Keep in mind

* Start thinking about defense date (sometime in February?)
