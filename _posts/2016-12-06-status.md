## What have I worked on?

* `checkerboard`: edited protocol to be a single shot experiment.

* `networkEWS`: some reading, some simulation, some conceptual development.

* `reading`: new _Ecology_ stat report ([here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-0093.1/full)) argues ordination scores of interaction matrix are a measure of diet breadth. I guess this means that what I considered a measure of parasite community composition per host species in [this paper](https://taddallas.github.io/papers/Dallas2016Helminth.pdf) could be considered a measure of host range (by the same logic applied in their paper)?

* `macroHelminth`: some small edits. NODF stuff is still running, so I can't do much until that's done.

* `helminthR`: looked into the feasibility of scraping the year off host-parasite citation records. Many don't have years, and the ones that do don't necessarily follow a specific citation format (I'd basically be splitting up each string and looking for 4 consecutive numbers).

* `newIdeas`: took some time to sit and think, play around with some of the helminth data, etc. It was good. I should probably be working more on beetle projects now though.



## What should I be working on now?


* `rangeLean`: play around with the code, and think about final plots generated from model

* `beetleLab`: logistics. We're behind on data entry, dishes, etc. Get `priorityEffects` data entered at a minimum.
