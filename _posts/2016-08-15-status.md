## What have I worked on?

* `jobApps`: research statement tweaks. Inquiry sent about friendly review.

* `priorityEffects`: Starts next week. Exciting.

* `thresholdDensity`: edits.

* `srsMetacom`: I made a coding error that I didn't catch until the manuscript had been accepted. This was really embarrassing. I reached out to the editor, and we're in the process of assessing the size of the changes to the manuscript, which thankfully are quite minimal. Mistakes happen, and I'm really thankful that I decided to publish code alongside my data. If it weren't for me going through and re-reading all my code to reproduce the analysis, I wouldn't have caught the mistake.


## What should I be working on now?

* `thresholdDensity`: more edits
*  `rangeShape`: push this along.
*  `reading`: it's like Pokemon Go, but instead of walking around catching Pokemon, I'm sitting in my current non-air conditioned office _catching_ scientific research.
