title: Status for January 19
author: Tad

It's been awhile. My bad. Postdoc interview at Davis went really well. Came back and presented at the Graduate Student Symposium here at the Odum School, which also went pretty well. Lots of great talks. Now it's back to business. I have about 3 weeks until my completed dissertation needs to be in my committee's hands.

## What did I work on today?

* `introbio`: taught lab

* `tempVar`: ramp up neonate farming as needed (looking to start this experiment around January 30 or 31.

* `thresholdDensity`: analytical solution for stochastic model. Learning about nonhomogenous Poisson processes.





## What should I be working on tomorrow


* `hostRange`: accuracy and bias measures of range prediction.

* `srsMetacom`: make sure the supplement is edited to reflect change in magnitude measure, and send along to collaborators (when ready)
