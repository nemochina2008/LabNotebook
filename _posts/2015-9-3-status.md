## What did I work on today?

* `Competition` manuscript revision submitted (fingers crossed)

* `GlobalHelminth` and `NodeProperties` work

* Reading for journal club. Some cool looking articles this week!  ([1](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1814/20151130), [2](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1814/20151478), [3](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1814/20151656); not to mention [Rhia's work](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1814/20151436))




## What should I be working on tomorrow?

* Meeting with John
	
* `Threshold` edits (seemingly never-ending!); discuss issues with John during Friday meeting

* First Friday! Beer beer beer. <i class="fa fa-beer"> </i>

### Keep in mind

* [`FishParasite`](https://github.com/taddallas/FishParasite8910) manuscript nearly ready. Make small tweaks, get John's comments, and then submit

* `VerticaBd` work needs some love. What's the real hook, and what's the target journal/audience?

* `SRS` projects to push along. Put priority on `SRSmetacom`.
