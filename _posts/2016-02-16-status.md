## What did I work on today?

* `tempVar`: experiment still running. Need to hop on scope soon (this weekend)

* `teach`: lab @ lakeHerrick. Proposals in my hands.

* `dissertation`: presentation and edits


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `dissertation`: read Brooks and Dodson 1965, because I think it may come up in defense (`competition`)
