## What did I work on today?

* `paperBlurb`: wrote a pretty little blurb about a paper I'm working on as part of a special issue. More on that to come.

* `dissertation`: a bit of formatting. Pretty much ready to submit.

* `macroHelminth`: paper I'm working on with some folks looking at testing macroecological theory with helminth parasites. Made a bunch of edits today.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar` stuff
