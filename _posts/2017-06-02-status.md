## What have I worked on?
 
* `popBuffering`: John's comments, tons of edits, and re-submitted. This honestly took the entire day. This is all I did. Woof. Relatedly,  I read at least 60 pages of [this book](http://izt.ciens.ucv.ve/ecologia/Archivos/References-I-biol/books-biol/Biology/McCallum-Population_Parameters.pdf). Pretty solid overview of aspects of population ecology. 
  




### Tonight 

* `beer`: I am going to drink some after a nice long day of manuscript revisions. 




## What should I be working on now? 

* `artMuseum`: [new exhibitions](https://manettishremmuseum.ucdavis.edu/visit/current_exhibitions.html)

* `hostRange`: work towards re-submission (reach out to Patrick to see if he has any final comments) 
 
* `review`: neat article. Lots to think about in it. 

* `nodeProperties` and `thresholdDensity`: incorporate John's edits (think about that sweet ternary plot idea)

* `RCN_dimgen`: provide comments/edits if you have any. 

* `srsSuccession`: push forward conceptually based on John, Marcus, and Drew's comments. I imagine Marcus will be essential for this project with his crazy detailed knowledge of these zooplankton species.
