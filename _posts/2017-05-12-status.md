## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects1+2`: single species model fits, model testing, and data validation
  
* `srsSuccession`: pushed along. Some interesting stuff. 

* `compStress`: species interactions are hypothesized to less negative in more stressful environments (stress gradient hypothesis). Evidence for this is largely from plant literature and some sessile marine organism stuff. This is easily testable in the beetle system, varying habitat quality and estimating both intraspecific and interspecific effects in a 2 (or 3) species system. Wrote up quick protocol but need to think about the underlying mechanism a bit more, and how this work adds to [existing ideas](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23597120.pdf). 


* `checkerBoard2`: pushed along idea about comeptition-associated dispersal, and if beetles use information about the receiving patch during dispersal. 





## What should I be working on now? 


* `priorityEffects`: continue with model fitting and checking and such

* `checkerBoard2`: push along. 

* `compStress`: think about it some more.
