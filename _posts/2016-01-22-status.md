## What did I work on today?

* `thresholdDensity`: e-mailed Marty with current status of project and updated plots

* `dissIntro`: Edits and additions. It's shaping up.

* `hostRange`: worked through the accuracy matrix calculations. Code kept bonking on the cross validation step with limited data. Fixed code, ran models, got confusing results that I need to unpack.



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar`: look through and edit manuscript text based on reviewer concerns

* `helminthR`: re-submit

* `nicheClass`: develop protocol for project
