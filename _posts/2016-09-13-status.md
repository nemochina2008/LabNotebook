## What have I worked on?

* `reading`: short new Lafferty and Mordecai forum style piece
* `networkEWS`: sketched out some plotting code and gathered sim data.
* `rangeShape`: writing and finding weak spots in argument. Working out the meta-narrative, and relegating things to main text or supplement or garbage bin.
* `alanMeeting`: pitched `rangeShape` and `networkEWS` with good response.


## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: calculate environmental distance only when considering a species niche center. Otherwise, the correlation between distance and abundance could simply mask a nonlinear relationship. It's also conceptually easier to relate environmental distance to niche center than geographic center.

* `parasiteRange` and `flatEarth`: not during work hours, but should push these along.

* stop being silly and dive in to the FIA data. This is important to what will likely eventually be called `rangeLean` or something like that.

* `priorityEffects`: week 3 counts are tomorrow. Stocks are doing well, and everything is decently stable and good.
