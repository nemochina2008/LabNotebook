## What have I worked on?
 
* `beetleMeeting`: went well. Not much to report. Looked into machine shop to build some more sieves. Got info from Brett, and passed along ordering info to Bill. 

* `rangeShape`: completed a final run through. Small polishing edits. Sent to Alan for his feedback before submission. 

* `priorityEffects1`: made small tweaks. Brett said he'd look at this soon. 

* `prevOcc`: ironed out some logistical details. 

* `sizeDistro`: set up a quick test experiment. May be interesting, but will be a background project. 

* `zika`: manuscript accepted for publication in eLife. Great team to work with, and excited to see how folks react to what the editors called "a shining example of how machine-learning based methods can lend new approaches to analyses of emerging infectious diseases."




### Tonight 


* `arc`: run, run, run.


* `helmSize`: edits to methods and results sections. Let Ignacio take introduction. Clearly sketch out the main findings. Lots of collaborators means lots of ideas for side-analyses, but we should keep the main findings succinct.


* `checkerboard`: enter data if you work up the energy to head back to campus.

 
* `labNotebook`: if I get bored, I'd like to edit the Github activity tab on this labNotebook, as it currently is _super_ ugly.





## What should I be working on now? 

* `checkerboard`: data from gen 1 needs to be entered (if you didn't do it already). 


* `experimentIdeas`: something with habitat quality or _T. madens_. Maybe seed some preliminary trials this week to see if _T. madens_ can even disperse through the current holes. 


* `priorityEffects1`: more edits. Think critically about final plots. Most are there, but want to make sure everything is tip-top.
