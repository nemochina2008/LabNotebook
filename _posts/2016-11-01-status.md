## What have I worked on?

* `alanMeeting`: went well. Friendly review of `rangeShape` and `flatEarth`. Discussed ways forward for `priorityEffects` analysis and monitoring.

* `priorityEffects`: 200 million Ricker models. Oof. Now onto the pmf's.

* `labLogistics`: Flour order finalized. Need more red, pink, and blue lab tape (e-mailed Bill). Spent the morning making patches and doing lab work. I like lab work. Here's to hoping I can still do lab work if/_when_ I'm in a professorship. Unlikely.

* `macroHelminth`: scrape turned into small tweaks to `helminthR` itself. Mainly error-handling, but then I decided that I should run a bunch of tests. Haven't pushed changes yet, but if all goes well, nobody will be able to tell the difference.


## What should I be working on now?

* `macroHelminth`: keep plugging away
* `priorityEffects`: pmf time
* `reading`: two competition articles that need a second thorough read.
