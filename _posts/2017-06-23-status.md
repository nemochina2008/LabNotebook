## What have I worked on?
 

* `centConserve` is running at home and `graphDissim` is in Tim's hands

* `labProject`: couple of small edits, but this is largely in other hands.

* `WOSfail`: re-structured text a little bit. Added Github issue to solicit feedback on project as a whole. 

* `checkerBoard2`: solicited feedback from Brett and Geoff

* `thresholdDensity`: passed updated manuscript to Marty for final comments

* `flatEarth`: submitted. Oof. 








### Tonight


* `berkeley`: heading to Berkeley for a few days to see Maheen and work on some collaborative projects with Colin. Need to dust off those projects and get in that headspace. 


* `beetleLab`: dishes + Mountain Goats?
