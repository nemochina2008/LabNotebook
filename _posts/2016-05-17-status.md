 Since I last updated my lab notebook, I did the whole graduation + family time thing, and a fair amount of the _get rid of everything I own_ thing. While not doing those two things, I managed to push along two RCN projects, submitted a manuscript from my dissertation work (`tempVar` infection), and a class project that was rejected from _Biology Letters_ and _Ecology_ (currently in review at _Parasitology_ and available [here](https://github.com/taddallas/FishParasite8910)). 

## What did I work on today?

* `nodeProperties`: figures all up to date, but text needed sprucing. Text edits made, and sent to collabs for suggestion and writing.

* `hostRange`: a spot of writing, but still seems a bit thin.

* `labProject`: pretty data dashboard for zooplankton data

* `website`: deleted some unused files I kept around for no good reason. Did some minor tweaks. Today was kind of one of those days where no _actual_ work gets done.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `tempVar` population: much needed reading and thinking.

* `nicheClass`: make hexbin plot with both groups of points on same plot. Make sure that hexbin environments are properly translated into geographic space.

* `VerticaBD`: Push this along and pass to John for comments soon-ish.
