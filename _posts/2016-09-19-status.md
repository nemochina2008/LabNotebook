## What have I worked on?

* `rangeShape`: Submitted TRY request to get at trait data. Beat up phylogeny. Continued to work on structure of introduction, thanks to some great information from Gaston 2003 _The Structure and Dynamics of Geographic Ranges_.  Squashed bug in using max pop size as centroid for FIA data. This could _really_ strengthen the manuscript thesis as a supplemental analysis. Added more fish data sources, and did some plotting.

* `rangeLean`: repo is set up, and some preliminary analysis is done. Looped Robin in on the project, and solicited feedback.

* `reading`: couple of chapters of Gaston 2003, along with Holt and Keitt 2000 _Ecol Letters_ and Pigot and Tobias 2013 _Ecol Letters_


## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: writing.

* `logistics`: stock census and AME tomorrow. Start moving away from continuous beetle farming if possible without crashing stocks. Have undergrads check out the old balance and make sure that they're good with it. It's a bit slower to final value, but values obtained from both balances seem to match up well.
