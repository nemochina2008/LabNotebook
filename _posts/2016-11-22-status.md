## What have I worked on?

* `priorityEffects`: more introduction text. Will hold off until next meeting with Alan and Brett to see if I'm going in the right direction, or if I'm writing the introduction to the second paper of this experiment.

* `nodeProperties`: supplemental table and figure edits. Text edits. Sent to collaborators for comments and tweaks before submission. Also, soliciting journal suggestions. Where do parasite sharing network papers go?

* `hostRange`: shunt some figures to supplement. Tweaked some figures to look better given two-column layout.

* `extinctionChapter`: write some of the abundance-based text, and clearly differentiate between local extinction and metapopulation extinction. Emphasized rescue effect/recolonization dynamics in the Levins' section.


* `parasiteSAR`: push along code for fitting different models



## What should I be working on now?

* RCN projects, `parasiteSAR`, and packing for trip
