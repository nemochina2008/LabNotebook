## What have I worked on?
 
* `beetleMeeting`: Met with Ty, Brett, and Alan to discuss `AME` project. 

* `priorityEffects`: small polishing. Need to run the `RickerMix` sims tonight. 
  
* `nodeProperties`: polishing edits. Collaborators going to weigh in with final comments in the next week or so. 

* `dispersalTrait`: push along manuscript text, and complimented with context-dependent dispersal analysis. 



### Tonight 

* `dispersalTrait`: update figures with NBBg model (need to run 10,000 simulations) 

* `priorityEffects`: still haven't figured out the rickerMix issues from last week. 



## What should I be working on now? 

* `checkerboard`: data entry, start pushing along analysis. 

* `priorityEffects2`: experiment will be done in less than 2 months. Sketch out analytical skeleton and main tests. 

* `experimentIdeas`: `prevOcc` can be started decently soon (need to create sieve for eggs). `sizeDistro` requires minimal maintenance, but will take some time next week. Maintain that experiment for a long time, and we'll have populations with historical contingency to experiment with.
