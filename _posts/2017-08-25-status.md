## What have I worked on?

* `emergence`: pushed code along. Created some features for pathogens, and worked most of the day on assembling more features from web data.

* `reading`: a bit of reading [this](http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royinterface/10/78/20120649.full.pdf) and the new Strayer et al. review in _Ecology Letters_

* `RCN`: conceptualized new RCN project. Plan to pitch it to a couple of folks soon and see what they think.


* `labLogistics`: flour details and some experimental clarification with undergrad team


## What should I be working on now? 

* `centConserve`: data assembly and push along

* `ropensciApp`: meeting on Monday at 1pm
