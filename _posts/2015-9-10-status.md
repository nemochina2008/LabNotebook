## What did I work on today?

* Changed course on the `SRSmetacom` work

Now have much of intro written. Still needs good conceptual figure. Start thinking about figures. Flesh out methods section. 

* Prepped data/code from published studies for Github 

* `VerticaBD` manuscript writing and inviting Drew to contribute 
Drew accepts.

* Reboot of `TempVar`-infection. 
This project aims to look at how infection dynamics are influenced by variation in the duration of exposure to varying temperatures. I thought I had a nice little paper that looked at host filtering rate, pathogen survival in the environment, and infection dynamics in host populations, but it got torn apart in review. I'm revising my experimental design, scrapping some aspects of the old experiment, and seeing if I can't address all reviewer concerns in one fell swoop, consisting of two more experiments. 

* Prepped(?) for fellowship interview

### Keep in mind

* [`FishParasite`](https://github.com/taddallas/FishParasite8910) manuscript nearly ready. Make small tweaks, get John's comments, and then submit (incorporate [Strona's recent parasite extinction review paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213224415300134)!)
