## What have I worked on?
 
* `missingLinks`: accepted. Hooray!

* `stochasticPops`: Sebastian Schreiber is teaching a course on stochastic population dynamics. It's good. 

* `labLogistics`: did some dishes 

* `detEnv`: revived this project, as I think it can be run alongside stocks without too much effort. Plus, it's relatively short (6 gen max)

* `codeReview`: code prettied up for `missingLinks`, `popBuffering`, and `rangeShape`. 

* `srsSuccession`: pushed along a tiny bit just for funsies. Other projects are largely in collaborator's hands. Should probably think of more beetle experiments!

* `reading` 



### Tonight

* `run`: silly 800 work with running club (3 x (800, 1min rest, 800, 5min rest) at 5k pace)


  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `priorityEffects`: both 1 and 2. 1 for model testing (running currently) and 2 for dev.
