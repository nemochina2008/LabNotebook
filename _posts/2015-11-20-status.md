## What did I work on today?

* `Threshold` code and plotting

* `nodeProperties`: re-ran analysis, and now it's time to sit and think on it...then write.

* `resistanceCosts`:  _Ecology and Evolution_ wants me to format my manuscript as `.doc`, and won't accept the LaTex that they previously accepted as a submission. I've emailed them to see if they'll accept the raw tex code and files necessary for compilation.

* `macroHelminth`:  finished downloading updated helminth data using `helminthR`, and now need to dig into it.




## What should I be working on tomorrow

* Idk. Something fun. It'll be nice enough, so either a hike with Julie or a nice long run at Lake Herrick or the Botanical Gardens.

* dissertation formatting
   + tables and figures need short titles
   + where would supplemental material from journal article go in dissertation?


* `nodeProperties`: do it.
