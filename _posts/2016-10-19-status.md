## What have I worked on?

* `rangeLean`: started pushing forward modeling component

* `labLogistics`: I checked on the references of two potential undergraduate workers. Strange task that made me feel like a grown up.

* `spatialProjects`: came up with a decent idea, and pushed it along to protocol stage. I think it could be performed alongside of stock maintenance and other experiments without much extra effort.

* `missingLinks`: dusted this project off, and edited some of the manuscript text. Pretty much ready to be released into the world.

* `teary`: good discussion. Drake some coffee. Fun times.




## What should I be working on now?

* `nodeProperties`: work on it and pass to collaborators.

* `rangeLean`: read and work
