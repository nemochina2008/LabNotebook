## What have I worked on?

* `jobApp`: teaching statement.


* `rangeShape`: could the sharp range limit be a function of negative density dependent dispersal? The idea being that it's costly to disperse too far ahead of the invasion front, because mate-finding Allee effect, so individuals in the tail will fold back onto the invasion front. This wouldn't explain a sharp boundary for plants, but it could for animals.


* `website`: update pubs page and cv



## What should I be working on now?

* `jobApp`: diversity statement, and edits to teaching and research statements.

* `srsMetacom`: formatting files, getting data/metadata pretty, and other small logistics
