## What did I work on today?

* `hostRange`: Further refined text. Got prepared to talk about this with John. Accuracy measure straightened out.

* `thresholdDensity`: Still more model tweaking. I had a dream that the pathogen could be vertically transmitted, and that explained why the models didn't fit well. In real life, it probably wouldn't explain the disparity between deterministic and stochastic versions of the same model.

* `read`: [New-ish cool paper from Tucker et al.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.02803/abstract), this neat [collaborative filtering paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.08439.pdf), and this [species richness estimation paper](http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2014_reese_g001.pdf). Maybe I should stop reading as a method to procrastinate from writing?

* `drakeTime`: met with John. Productive. Suggested analytical solution to stochastic `thresholdDensity` model.



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `georeference`: Need to start getting after that

* `read`:
