## What have I worked on?

* `rangeShape`: finalized the set of data sources I plan to use for this project. Sharpened the focus, and laid down some solid code. Read more from Gaston and re-read Sexton _et al._ 2009 _Annual Review_ and Borregaard _et al_ 2010 _Quart Review Bio._

* `logistics`: requested more flour for the beetles. Organized lab and stocked a few odds and ends. We now have a camera and a 32g SD card, so we can take at least 10,000 low quality pictures of beetles. Is it big data yet? No. No, it is not.

* `laSelva`: re-visit the package and read more of the crazy lengthy _documentation_ (over 500 pages between phases 2 and 3 of the Forest Inventory and Analysis data). I want to use the data, but the pre-processing steps are going to take a fair amount of time and patience.



## Tonight?

* `zika`: update the variable importance plots. Provide ms comments to Michelle.



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: Start sketching out a manuscript outline. Draft thesis paragraph. Sketch out what plots will be most informative.

* `rickerSpace`: sit down and think more about it. It can be used for theoretical support to Geoff's `rangeLimit` project, but it's definitely useful for more.
