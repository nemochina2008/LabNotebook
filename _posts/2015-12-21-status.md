## What did I work on today?

* `resistanceCost`: Will wait until after the holidays to bother anybody about it.

* `labAutopilot`: made sure things were clean, organized, and clearly labeled with instructions. Infection farm not looking all that great for some reason. I started secondary infection farm, and will check as soon as I get back.

* `VerticaBD`: Pushed manuscript text and plotting along. Performed cluster analysis. Eh.

* `hostRange`: Read [this solid book chapter](https://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/manuscriptpdfs/Gotelli_Chao_Encyclopedia_2013.pdf) and [this review](http://macroecointern.dk/pdf-reprints/WaltherMoore2005.pdf). Helped clarify some stuff. How I currently measure accuracy increases as the relative size of the training set gets smaller, because the estimated range gets large. It's not a great accuracy measure because of this. I made some pretty plots of the garbage accuracy measure though.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `travel`: Do it. Download audiobook?
