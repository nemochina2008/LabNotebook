### Since last week

* `extinctionChapter`: pushed along. Need to tie link between patch occupancy and abundance models.

* `priorityEffects`: Slow-going since I'll be reading things like _Discrete Multivariate Distributions_ as a first step in the analysis. Oof.

* `reading`: oodles of reading interesting articles.

* `rangeLean`: played around with model more, but waiting on Robin for the finished product before I dive too much into that.

* `parasiteSAR`: pushed along the idea a bit. This is a low-level side project (weekend and holidays) that is half-formed, but is looking to test some aspects of species-area relationships using parasites.



## What have I worked on today?

* `popBuffering`: revived and revised. Shaping up.

* `missingLinks`: emailed collaborators about current manuscript draft and suggestions for reviewers and associate editors.

* `stochProcesses`: read about 5 pages out of _Stochastic Population Processes_. It's not going to be a page-turner, but I think it'll be super helpful.




## What should I be working on now?

* `popBuffering`: continue pushing this along.

* `prepForLecture`: Giving another lecture in Alan's population biology course on diffusion processes this Thursday. Need to read material and start sketching out notes.
