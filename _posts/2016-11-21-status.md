## What have I worked on?

Today was far less about doing stuff, and more about figuring out what I need to be doing. I definitely did push along some projects (see below), but I also took stock of current project stage, and tried to identify ways forward. Much of my current experimental work is waiting on logistics (can't have more than a couple experiments running at once or we can't handle the workload).


### experimental projects

* `priorityEffects`: introductory and methods text. read up on discrete multivariate distributions.

* `dispersalTrait`: need to figure out a way to mark beetles easily. painting each individually seems like a fool's errand.

* `previousOccupancy`: waiting until `priorityEffects` is done. I think the experiment looks solid, but it's a work-intensive one (900 patches total). Maybe try to trim down replicates.

### side projects

* `parasiteSAR`: pushed along workflow and analysis. Produced a couple of plots, but nothing final. Need to read _a lot_ before proceeding. Read 3 papers, and laid down some preliminary ideas about workflow structure. Uncharted territory, so I may take this one slowly.

* `popBuffering`: in lab hands

* `extinctionChapter`: write the abundance/synchrony section, and discuss the role of dispersal. Move some of the earlier discussion of dispersal down (especially since you start with spatially implicit models)

* `rangeShape` and `flatEarth`: in Alan's hands

* `rangeLean`: model dev in Robin's hands currently. Will be in mine soon, so need to continue to brush up on my C++ (and by "brush up", I mean "re-learn").



### RCN

* `nodeProperties`: update supplemental tables with recent analyses. Check to see if text all still agrees with the results, and then pass a note to collaborators containing a submission deadline

* `hostRange`: incorporated Charlie's comment, and waiting on other people to read it.

* `macroHelminth`: looking solid. Vanessa is working on discussion and coherence between modules. I have some code running that will hopefully be done soon.

* `parasiteSAR`: reading, some writing.




## What should I be working on now?


* `dispersalTrait`: think more about how to mark beetles. Maybe run some preliminary trials tomorrow (when stocks are counted).

* `extinctionChapter`: write words good.

* `parasiteSAR`: lay down more code that isn't as ugly as existing packages for fitting species-area relationships.

* `hostRange`: shunt a figure or two to text, read through and tweak text (small bits), and draft cover letter.
