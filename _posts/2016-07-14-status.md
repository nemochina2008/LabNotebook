## What have I worked on?


* `review`: _J Vector Ecology_ article
*




## What should I be working on now?

* `dataScan`: scan beetle data from this week for stocks and ongoing experiment

* `roleConservation`: scale node measures to network max, allowing for direct comparison across networks (at least that's my argument).
