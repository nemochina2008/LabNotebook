## What have I worked on?

* `macroHelminth`: review article fell by wayside as coauthors worked on sections independently. Now it's in my hands, with some parts done, and some parts sadly never started. Pushed along a bunch today. Sent to collabs and uloaded manuscript text to Overleaf for some collaborative editing.

* `spatialExperiments`: `dispersalTrait` is ready to go once equipment arrives, and I may wait until we get a couple more undergrads in the lab. There are other longer term questions that should start to be addressed. Conceptualized a couple experimental protocols to run by Alan and Brett.

* `logistics`: checked in with Bill about ordering supplies, and took stock of lab materials.

* `newProjects`: tossed some project ideas around with Colin.


### Tonight

* `spatialExperiments`: push along spatial project protocols



## What should I be working on now?

* `nodeProperties`: Update RSelenium script for pulling citation number information.
