## What have I worked on?

* `missingLinks`: last minute text tweaks. Wrote cover letter and stalked reviewers. Submitted to _PLoS Computational Biology_. Fingers crossed.

* `parasiteSAR`: Colin's in. Repo created. Need to get IUCN shapefiles for mammals and examine differences between my data and that data. Hopefully they are at least proportional.

* `thresholdDensity`: project has sadly hit the backburner. Worked on reviving it today. Edited responses to reviewers, and passed along to collaborators for their input. 

* `reading`: [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.02480/epdf) and [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.12713/epdf)

* `networkEWS`: pushed along conceptually, and laid down a bit of code to make prettier plots. Needs a bit more backbone. Work on this tonight. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeLean`: Visual Studio installed, so it's time to C++ it up. Robin will not be able to push this along until after her quals (makes sense), so use the model for exploration. Start mapping out what final plots should look like. 

* `professionalService`: review second manuscript

* `macroHelminth`: push along the connectance argument (or trim it down), as it confused the shit out of some people at the RCN. 

* `checkerboard`: scale landscape size down (can be as small as two patches). This will make the experiment more feasible, and enhance replication. It can be argued that 2 patches would impose dispersal barriers. Need to think about this. It's worth the sacrifice if we can examine a finer dispersal limitation gradient.
