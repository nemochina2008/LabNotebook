## What have I worked on?
 

* `helmSize`: Made prettier plots and pushed forward text. Pulling in coauthors now. 

* `hostRange`: tightened up responses to reviewers and incorporated Charlie's comments. 

* `commSpread`: protocol dev. Looking good. 

  

### Tonight

* `helmSize`: tap collaborators for help with discussion. 

* `priorityEffects`: get models running in parallel. 

* `reading`: Yalcin and Leroux 2017 "Diversity and suitability of existing methods and metrics for quantifying species range shifts"



## What should I be working on now? 

* `commSpread`: continue dev
 
* `notes`: sketch out some ideas for what Alan was talking about the other day. Maybe read a bit.

* `priorityEffects2`: data cleaning.
