## What have I worked on?
 
* `thresholdDensity`: final version ready to go with code updated and tossed to figshare. 
  
* `rangeLean`: edited introduction for better flow. Set up nicely, but unsure of methods structure. Depends on how compelling modeling work is. 


* `WOSfail`: organized search queries and made some small text edits to manuscript.


* `flatEarth`: fine polishing. John signed off on it, so it's on me to submit when ready. 


* `graphDissim`: spent far too long tweaking a conceptual figure by incorporating PhyloPics. Appropriate to have a dinosaur in there? Who knows?

* `centConserve`: conceptual framework and manuscript introduction dev


* `emergence`: tossed skeleton protocol on Overleaf




### Tonight 

* `centConserve`: analysis. Plots with host and parasite species. 




## What should I be working on now? 

* `graphDissim`, `rangeLean`, and pushing `flatEarth` and `thresholdDensity` towards submission
