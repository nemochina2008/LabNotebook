## What did I work on today?

* `defensePres`: Worked on the general outline and pushed along `nitrate` chapter section

* `dissertation`: John provided comments on `thresholdDensity` and `tempVar`. These need to be addressed before defense.

* `tempVar`: experiment still running. Need to hop on scope soon (this weekend)


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `defensePres`: Make it pretty and not suck (push along `competition` and `tempVar` sections)



## Soon

* `dissertation`: John provided comments on `thresholdDensity` and `tempVar`. These need to be addressed before defense.
