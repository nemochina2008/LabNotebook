## What have I worked on?
 
* `barnerReview`: finished friendly review of neat article
  
* `reading`: some articles on habitat size, demography stochasticity, and population dynamics

* `dimgen_RCN`: E-mailed Andrew back about a project he's pushing forward

* `priorityEffects`: two-species model fits look decent, but this can't be pushed ahead until we have upper density treatments included.

* `flourTest`: discussed the project over email a bit with Geoff. 

* `rangeLean`: discussed project status with Robin. Decided on a couple ways forward. Implemented some of the small stuff. Need to work on the manuscript structure. 

* `ESAdisease`: submitted application for the Best Student Paper award, offering up the new one on link prediction in host-parasite networks that just appeared in _PLOS Computational Biology_.

* `MPAbeetle`: talked with Easton about a protocol he has for beetle work. 

* `popBuffering`: gave it another read through and passed along to John to see if he agrees with everything. 





### Tonight 

* `rangeLean`: re-make plots standardizing for latitudinal range size. Work on manuscript text.





## What should I be working on now? 

* `thresholdDensity`: continue edits based on Frank's comments

* `flatEarth`: write words good.

* `flourTest`: continue refining protocol
