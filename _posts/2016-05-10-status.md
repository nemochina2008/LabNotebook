## What did I work on today?

* `tempVar` infection: comments incorporated. need to read through and tweak before submission

* `tempVar` population: pushed along two different projects, both examining population dynamics in variable environments

* `teach`: grades are in, and I proctored the final today, which marks the last task I have to do for UGA. Tight.

* `hostRange`: checked out an evenness angle, but it just confused me more. Need to sit down and really provide a firm link between simulation and empirical data, specifically with regards to the structure of parasite-level data. This may sound ambiguous, but I'll post more on it soon, and hopefully make it open (RCN folks are involved, so it's private currently).

* `Read`: [cool new paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12609/full) from Piet's lab

## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `hostRange`: Think think think...then do.

* `tempVar` population: keep pushing along. May need to sit and read and think for awhile about causal mechanisms underlying extinction in variable environments (increased synchrony, size of pop fluctuations, etc.). Do more variable environments result in more variable population dynamics? Time to read some theory (e.g., [Alvarez 2001](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002850100108)).
