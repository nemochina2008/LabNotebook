## What have I worked on?
 
* `metacomEmail`: somebody had a question about the 2014 _Ecosphere_ paper. I answered it.

* `checkerboard`: how much do adult beetles disperse in 24 hours? A decent amount. 

* `thresholdDensity`: solidified text and responses to reviewers. Send back to coauthors for approval before resubmission. 

* `meetingWithAlan`: discussed `checkerboard` start, `priorityEffects` part 2 analyses, and additions to undergrad team (hiring one more student worker soon; likely interviewing within the next week or two).

* `priorityEffects`: I made some quick plots to serve as talking points during the meeting on Thursday for `priorityEffects1`. Alan had a good suggestion for a plot for `priorityEffects2`. I've started setting up the workflow for this project, but a bunch of the data aren't validated yet. 


* `helmsize`: removed some outliers in terms of body size, and pretty plots turned into garbage plots. :(




### Tonight

* `macroHelminth`: edits based on Vanessa's suggestions

* `popBuffering`: update plots and text. Keep working on conceptual dev in intro. 



  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `appliedMath`: class that I'm auditing. Educational equivalent of eating kale (it's good for you, but sucks unless prepared just right). 


* `priorityEffects`: check up on data validation. Run through some.
