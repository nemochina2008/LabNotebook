## What have I worked on?
 
* `missingLinks`: proofs 

* `priorityEffects1`: testing model with simulated data (meeting today at 1pm). 

* `priorityEffects2`: start pushing along conceptually. Clean the most recent data. 

* `beetleMeeting`: went well. Some paths forward, or at least more things to try. Spent most of the day working on trying things.


### Tonight 

* `notPriorityEffects`: need to take a step back for the night. Work on `RCN` projects, dishes, `codeReview`, etc. 

  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `priorityEffects`: keep testing model and such
