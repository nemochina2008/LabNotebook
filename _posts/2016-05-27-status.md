## What have I worked on?

* `tempVar: popBuffering`: pushed along some plots and analyses. A bit of narrative as well. Seems like some interesting stuff.

* `BarrigaNetwork`: read and thought a bit about Taylor's law.



## What should I be working on now?

* `RCN`:
  + `BarrigaNetwork`: Taylor's law thinking/analysis
  + `spatialVariation`: Network properties in space (be sure to control for matrix size and/or host diversity [link](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173430))
