## What have I worked on?

* `esaDisease`: worked on website. Facebook integration is still not working. Dumb.

* `beetleMeeting`: meeting with Alan tomorrow. Got prepped for meeting. 

* `priorityEffects`: small tweaks.

* `rangeLean`: sketched out ideas for plots incorporating model results. On a bit firmer conceptual footing now, and have a clearer idea of how model ties into the observational data. 

* `networkEWS`: solidified the approach by writing part of the methods for the model. Before I go too deep into this, I should pitch the model to Alan or Easton to see if they see anything horribly wrong with it. 




## What should I be working on now?


* `reading`:

* `dataEntry`:

* `networkEWS`: continue to push along
