## What have I worked on?
 
* `beetleMania`: day 2. Lots of talking. Some 3d plotting. Some directions forward. Tomorrow will be a discussion of broad ideas and next steps. 


* `checkerBoard1`: Allison's suggested edits to the text.

* `genbankGMPD`: read through Andrew's code and marveled at just how much he loves to pipe things (even to the point of piping a print statement in, instead of just having `print` or `head` or `str` call on another line. 



### Tonight

* `genbankGMPD`: Run the code (couldn't do during the day because of model fitting sucking up too much memory)


* `checkerBoard1`: run simulations again to get at estimates of species coexistence for model simulations (or just wait because the parameter estimates will be informed by `priorityEffects` anyways, which may change. 


* `rangeLean`: code ready to go for plotting



  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `professionalService`: review article
