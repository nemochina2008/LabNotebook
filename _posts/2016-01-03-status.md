## What did I work on today?

* `tempVar`: prepped for individual experiment. Made 2 carboys of hardwater media, printed off updated protocol, prepped tubes, etc. Will hit neonate farming hard after postdoc interview

* `metacom`: setup up `codecov` for the `metacom` package. Useful info.

* `dissertation`: sent out first chapter (`nitrate`) to committee

* `courseEvals`: Students say the darndest things. I'm not going to reveal too much, but a couple gems include:

> He graded really harsh and made the course far more challenging than it should be.

> This was a useless lab.

* `icanhazpostdoc`: more reading and some general thinking


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `fishParasite`: _Biology Letters_ chose to pass on this one after a round of revision (i.e., *rejected*). The current plan is to keep in a letters format, alter the analysis a tiny bit (include host taxonomic information) along with some minor text edits. Can the phylogenetic community ecology bandwagon pump the brakes please?
