## What did I work on today?

* `labMeeting`: zoop team (I'm on zoop team) beat out team smallpox in the ongoing interactive visualization competition this week with this [dope map](http://drakelab.github.io/srsLabProject/) and this [dope dashboard](http://drakelab.github.io/srsLabProject/bayProfiles/bay78/index.html).

* `nicheClass`: Shaping up pretty nicely. Sketched out more firm protocol, and did some exploratory stuff. Furthered my knowledge of `h2o`.

* `meetingWithJohn`: John proposed using 30 m^2 environmental data.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `teach`: grade student research proposals, and enter grades

* `ecographyReview`: finish off if you can

* `zurich`: prep for travel. read lots more papers.
