## What have I worked on?
 
* `hostRange`: re-submitted over the weekend. ScholarOne hates LaTeX and associated users. 

* `RCN_dimgen`: provided comments

* `priorityEffects`: discussed with undergraduate team when they come in to do stocks. We are all on same page.

* `flourTest`: Incorporated Brett's comments. Will hopefully start this fairly soon. 

* `thresholdDensity`: remove composite modeling stuff, finalized some figures, and incorporated John's suggestions.

* `checkerBoard2`: pushed along manuscript analyses (need to make sure gen 3 data are cleaned though--currently a few odd values to check up on). 










### Tonight

* `run`

* `review`: Read through it twice. Time to start commenting.

* `thresholdDensity`: give it another read-through for clarity. 

* `sideProjects`: idk which, but it'd be nice to work on something else after spending most of the day working on beetle stuff. 

* `nodeProperties`: e-mail Patrick







  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `srsSuccession`: work on conceptual flow and narrow questions.

* `nodeProperties`: ready to go-ish. Work on cover letter and last minute polishing/style. 

* `habitatPartition`: think about incorporating this idea into the `flourTest` protocol.
