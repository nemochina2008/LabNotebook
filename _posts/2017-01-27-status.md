## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects1`: pushed along intro and methods 

* `islamicCenter`: recently the Islamic center in Davis [was vandalized](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Vandalized-mosque-leaves-Davis-resident-in-10881175.php). There was a community solidarity event in a park near campus. You can help repair the broken windows and other damage by [donating here](https://www.launchgood.com/project/help_repair_islamic_center_of_davis_after_hate_crime_damages#/). 

* `teary` and `appliedMath`: these things occurred, and they were good. 

* `prevOcc`: tweaked this experimental protocol. I like it, but need to run it by Alan and Brett before greenlighting. 

* `labLogistics`: called some references for undergraduate researcher candidates. 







  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `expDesign`: think about parsing out maternal effects from experimental evolution. Both Alan and Brett seem especially interested in beetle experiments which get at this, and I think it can be done. 
 

* `graphDissim`: there's something here. Set up the repo and push along conceptual skeleton of analytical workflow and manuscript skeleton. 


* other side projects (weekend party time!)
