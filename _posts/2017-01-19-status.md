## What have I worked on?
 
* `beetleMeeting`: went well. 

* `priorityEffects1`: 2-species models fit to data, but model needs tweaking. Continued to explore the data structure. Fit models to single species trials and obtained similar growth rates, which is heartening.

* `helmSize`: responded to a few initial comments on the issue tracker. Couple of cool angles to look into, either tomorrow night or sometime over the weekend. 

* `priorityEffects2`: use nearest neighbor trajectories to predict the trajectory of the `ind` pop, then determine distance between prediction and observed. 

* `labMeeting`: went well. Discussed lab project ideas. This will spill into next week, when we all come with our top ideas and vote on them. I'm stoked. 




### tonight 

* `arc`: run run run.


  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `thresholdDensity`: resubmit
