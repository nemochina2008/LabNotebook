## What have I worked on?

* `tempVarInfection`: revisions completed. Sent to John for edits.

* `dispersalTrait`: more preliminary trials

* `hostRange`: writing. Probably should get John's opinion on addition I made before I go too far down this road. Maybe also send to Shan for her opinion.

* `popBuffering`: Gabe suggested adding some form of modeling component, largely out of a fear that the results are too weak to stand by themselves. It is a bit weak, and I might just let this one die.

* `roleConservation`: ran into some conceptual issues as a result of the sparsity of some of the data. Need to rethink metrics, or use a different dataset.



## What should I be working on now?

* `dispersalTrait`: refine given what you've observed from the preliminary trials. Think about best way to mark beetles (currently thinking WhiteOut mixed with flourescent powder ... science, amiright?).

* `hostRange`: get this to a place where you feel comfortable sending to both John and Shan.

* `reading`: as `priorityEffects` runs, need to read lots and lots more to get grounded in the system and stochastic pop dynamics.



## Back of mind

* `priorityEffects`: 3 weeks to go time.
