## What have I worked on?

* `thresholdDensity`: read through and provided fine detail edits. Made sure formatting was set. 

* `genTime`: protocol dev with focus on logistics (lots of detail work required with this experiment)

* `flourTest`: started setting up for this experiment (labeled patches, put flour in them)

* `professionalService`: almost completed review







### Tonight 

* `run`



## What should I be working on now? 

* `centConserve`: pick up where you left off awhile back
