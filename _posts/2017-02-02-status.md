## What have I worked on?
 
* `beetleMeeting`: Some good conversation. 

* `priorityEffects1`: moved to Overleaf. Collaborators invited. 2 new figures made, and some small tweaks to existing figures. Text dev will proceed once coauthors read over skeleton. 


* `dispersalTrait`: green light. Build and label landscapes. Enlist undergraduates to paint beetles. This is going to be fun. Also, it allows me an excuse to start purposefully breeding beetles with certain traits. I knew a guy in charge of breeding mice for use in physiology labs and as snake food, and I once commented on how different the coat lengths and coloration seemed to be. He admitted to selectively breeding the mice for certain traits. I always thought that was funny. Perhaps that's what I'm doing now. Hopefully it has a future purpose to start the evolutionary differentiation of stock cultures.

* `hastingsLabMeeting`: discussed some ideas for lab projects. 

* `checkerboard`: some simulation and conceptual dev. 






### Tonight 


* `professionalService`: review article. 

* `arc`: time permitting. Core work and quick 5-6 miles. 



  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `checkerboard`: push along the conceptual ms flow

* `popBuffering`: John says it's ready to go. Fire when ready.

* `dispersalTrait`: start creating patches and making sure supplies exist.
