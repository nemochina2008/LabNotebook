## What have I worked on?

Just getting settled back in after the Society for Mathematical Biology conference. 

* `rangeShape`: edits pretty much finalized. Passed to Alan and Robin for comments/final touches. 
  
* `hostRange`: Ethics statement added. Final files submitted. 

* `extinctionChapter`: accepted with some minor revisions, most of which seem to fall on Colin. Exciting!

* `professionalService`: letter of rec for an undergraduate student researcher

* `clusterStuff`: working through some cluster use cases. Trying to see what I have access to and how to do the things. I am a child playing with play-doh.

* `centConserve`: spelled out main hypotheses and premise. 





### Tonight 

* `abundanceSDM`: how does spatial extent influence this relationship? Perhaps pull more species into it? 

* `centConserve`: make color depend on network size, double check variance sim function. 

* `julia`: keep learning the syntax. Maybe think of a project well suited for it's use (something heavy on simulation). 

* `read`





## What should I be working on now? 

* `abundanceSDM`: write introduction. 

* `normalNiche`: revise protocol and start laying down code. 

* `centConserve`: writing and thinking

* `checkerboard`, `priorityEffects1+2`, `dispersalTrait`: dust off and make polishing edits. Waiting on supplemental data to roll in, but once that happens, all these will be ready to go.
