title: Introduction to my open lab notebook
author: Tad
---


I've played with the idea of having an open lab notebook, and each time I convinced myself that it'd be a time sink, and something I'd grow disinterested in with time. However, here we are. I figured I'd give it a try. At best, it'll be a great way to keep my science (read as "scattered thoughts") a bit more organized. At worst, I'll abandon it after a bit. 

Either way, it's pretty straight-forward to modify if you'd like to have an open lab notebook. Even more so, I've developed a nice template using Jekyll that will have you well on your way to becoming an open science hipster in no time. Simply go [this Github repository](http://github.com/taddallas/LabNotebook/tree/sampleNotebook), which is a branch of my personal lab notebook, and fork it, clone it, or just download it. Then, follow the instructions in the `README` file that lives in the repo, and it'll guide you through the rest of the process. It's honestly quite easy, as most of the heavy lifting is done on the Github-side. 


Thanks for checking this out, and if you have any thoughts, feel free to let me know through Github's [issue tracker](http://github.com/taddallas/LabNotebook/issues), or through [email](mailto:tdallas@uga.edu).
