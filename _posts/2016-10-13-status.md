## What have I worked on?

* `professionalService`: review completed and sent in

* `nodeProperties`: WOS scrape for citation counts going slowly. Wrote RSelenium script to automate process, but hangs after it hits some verification page. Also some silly issues with university firewall, so I'm running RSelenium in a docker container that is being run in a linux virtual machine on a Windows machine. It feels wrong.

* `hostRange`: Shan's edits to intro incorporated, and sent back to team for further destruction of my writing.

* `spatialProjects`: sat and thought. Some small edits to `dispersalTrait`

* `Christmas`: bought plane tickets to go home for Christmas. A direct flight for cheap to a place a few hours away from my destination created some logistical hurdles involving buses and trains. Should be fun.


### Tonight

* `nodeProperties`: finished WOS scrape.


## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeLean`

* RCN projects like `nodeProperties` and `macroHelminth`
