## What have I worked on?

* `fiaData`: finally just sat down and started data munging. The seedling data seems like it will be most useful, but need to figure how to _adjust_ `TPA_UNADJ`. It's somewhere in the 400 page documentation manual. Read a good chunk of this manual, and still a bit confused about whether I can use `TPA_UNADJ` as a measure of tree density, or if I need to correct it somehow.

* `nodeProperties`: talked with Barbara. The discussion is in my hands now.

* `priorityEffects`: analytical workflow is shaping up.



## What should I be working on now?


* `rangeLean`: set up repo, and code up a couple of support functions.

* `rangeShape`: use FIA data for this project as well. It's going to help me understand the data structure, and will help strengthen this project. Submit TRY request. Beat up phylogeny.
