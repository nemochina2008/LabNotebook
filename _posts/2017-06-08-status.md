## What have I worked on?
 
* `graphDissim`: incorporated Tim's comments plus some polishing. 
  
* `checkerBoard2`: manuscript discussion dev and polishing. Passed to Easton for comments (he's working on something similar and so it's hopefully a win-win). 

* `jobPosting`: Advertising for 3-4 undergraduate positions in the lab beginning later this month and going at least to the end of the summer.

* `sizeDistro`: data up until `gen4` updated. Processing soon. 






### Tonight

* `rangeLean`: keep it fresh

* `macroHelminth`: revive the corpse. Specifically tackle the SAR stuff. Once the sections are pretty solid, ask Vanessa if she has time to go through and smooth and edit discussion. 





## What should I be working on now? 

* `smallExperiments`: protocols and ideas

* `rangeLean`: read through and make changes if appropriate
