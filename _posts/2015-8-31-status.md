## What did I work on today?

* `Competition` edits

* SRS brain trust meeting: charted some nice future directions. (two main ones for me: `srsMetacom` and `succession`)

Pushed at least the organization of ideas and some preliminary stuff along for both of these projects (mainly for `srsMetacom`). This seems like low-hanging fruit, but may be backburnered because of dissertation work.
 
* Registered for Georgia Health Connect South conference in Atlanta






## What should I be working tomorrow?

* Threshold host density work (never-ending!)

* `Competition` edits

* RCN `GlobalHelminth` work as it pertains to existing projects
