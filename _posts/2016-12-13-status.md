## What have I worked on?
 
* `hostRange`: wrote cover letter, and edited an existing LaTeX template that looks pretty and official. It's also easy to adjust it to make the letterhead suitable for any UC school and department. Kinda neat. Sent along to collaborators soliciting final polishing tweaks, and will hopefully submit over winter break. 


* `beetleMarking`: practiced marking beetles with oil-based paint pens. Affected movement too much to use for the planned experiment. Frustrating. Next up is tiny paint brushes and some form of non-toxic fast drying paint (maybe Testor's paint?)


* `checkerboard`: edited protocol, but made it too awesome for a one-shot. Whatever. Set it up and get it running before January 10th. In prep, get patches ready to go. Zac's on the drill making fresh lids. I've left much of data entry and validation to remaining team members, and volunteered to work through backlog of dishes. Keep an eye on flour stocks (already burned through roughly half of the large order we placed less than a month ago). 


* `nodeProperties`: discussed small stuff with Barbara. She's incorporating her edits into the Overleaf document currently. Should be within striking distance of submission in a couple of weeks (fingers crossed). 


* `extinctionChapter`: added bit about extinction time distribution and about predicting extinction (EWS). Need to polish metapop section. 



## What should I be working on now? 

* `networkEWS`: do it.
 
* `priorityEffects`: do it.

* `extinctionChapter`: finish off metapop section

* `nodeProperties`: incorporate Barbara's edits
