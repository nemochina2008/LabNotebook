## What have I worked on?

* `beetleTeam`: Skype meeting to discuss logistics

* `rangeShape`: pushed along text and analysis. Running into weird `ape` problem with `cophenetic.phylo` function

* `logistics`: box shopping, etc.

* `dispersalTrait`: Alan and Brett keen on pushing this forward. Edited protocol based on their suggestions. Could be ready to go as soon (or maybe slightly before) the assisted migration experiment ends.

* `flatEarth`: more of John's edits. Made tiny tweaks to 1-2 figures.



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: figure out issues, and push this forward.

* `rangeLean`: play around with data, and read docs.


<!--* `rangeLean`: time to use data.table or ff to cram some decently sized data into R-->
