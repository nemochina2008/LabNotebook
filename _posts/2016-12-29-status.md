## What have I worked on?
 
* `hostRange`: minor tweaks. Prettied up a couple figures. Made local copy the same as Overleaf. Edits to cover letter. Looks pretty solid to me. Will submit shortly. Fingers crossed.

* `nodeProperties`: lots and lots of changes based on collaborators' edits. Looking solid. Sent back to collabs for (hopefully) final edits before submission. 

* `labLogistics`: dish washing and lab cleaning. I got it down to 1 box of dishes before I left and come back to 4 full boxes. A bit Sisyphean.

* `reading`: [concept paper on metacommunities](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-016-3792-1)

* `spatialSpecial`: revived old project. Pushed along conceptually, but may not even pursue. Maybe focus on existing projects instead? 






## What should I be working on now? 

* `laselva`: haven't looked at it in forever, but is kind of fun. 
 
* `popBuffering`: push Easton to give comments on this whenever you see him. Bribe him with sak√©? 

* `priorityEffects`: figure the fitting error out. It's either a starting value issue, a finite limit issue, or there's a monster in the computer.
