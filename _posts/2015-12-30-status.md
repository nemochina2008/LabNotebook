## What did I work on today?

* `Daphnia`: stock maintenance and infection farming. Made sure nothing fell apart during break. Everything is in order.

* `gss`: Finished presentation. Minor tweaks to LaTex/beamer template. It looks pretty solid.

* `icanhazpostdoc`: First interview coming up. Reading _Chaos in Ecology_ and some other cool stuff to prepare. Read about 20 pages today. Need to sit and think about potential questions given the system, as well as come up some good interview questions about the position.

* `reading`: [This perspective piece](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12431/abstract)

## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `thresholdDensity`: Bang your head against this one for awhile.

* `resistanceCosts`: Corrections to proof, and send out reminder email to Andrea and Emily about invoice.

* `icanhazpostdoc`: more reading and thinking

* `barrigaNetwork`: Sketch out protocol and questions, and create some preliminary visualizations (maybe).
