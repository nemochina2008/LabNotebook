## What have I worked on?
 
* `appliedMath`: learned about the Euler-Lagrange equation and how it applies to calculus of variations. Pretty neat.

* `helmSize`: pushed it along. Shouldn't spend work time on it, but it was bothering me. Passed a note along to Alyssa that I think the manuscript is firm enough to solicit collaborators from the RCN. 


* `checkerboard`: data look intriguing, and thanks to slight change in how we do spatial experiments, I have solid estimates of adult dispersal rates for both species. 


* `priorityEffects`: meeting with Brett and Alan tomorrow to go over fitting issues. Read over what I have in order to prep for meeting. 


* `priorityEffects2`: set up repo and started to sketch out analytical workflow. Excited enough to see what these data look like that I may be back tonight to enter and validate data. 


* `NHMpredict`: small updates to package. Mainly just a refresher on what I've done and what the sticking points are. 


* `checkerboard`: pushed along repo organization and analytic workflow, but largely in a stylistic sense. Content to come soon. Excited about this project. 



  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `priorityEffects`: hopefully Brett and Alan can help me get past my stumbling block, and I can push these analyses forward. 


* `checkerboard`: analytical workflow dev. Intro manuscript dev.


* `helmSize`: run supplemental analyses tonight on data subsets
