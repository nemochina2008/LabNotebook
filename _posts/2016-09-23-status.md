## What have I worked on?

* `networkEWS`: worked on preliminary simulations

* `rangeShape`: new data source wasn't _actually_ what I needed. Edited manuscript accordingly. Wrote a fair chunk of results, and prettied up some tables and figures.

* `flatEarth`: made small changes. should be able to send to John by tomorrow.



### Tonight

* `flatEarth`: play around with outlining biodiversity hotspots on the Fig. 7 map.


## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape`: finalize Tables 1 and 2 (except for tree trait stuff)
