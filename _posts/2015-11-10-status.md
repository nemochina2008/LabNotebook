## What did I work on today?

* Re-submitted `resistanceCosts`

* `helminthR` dev, and manuscript edits (db is up)

* `FishParasite` edits, responses, and code formatting 

* `RH` made small change to network dissimilarity measure. I emailed group back. Next steps on that coming shortly. 




## What should I be working on tomorrow

* Create `md` file for each `DiseaseMacroecology` project outlining the next steps forward. Use issues to track smaller stuff. Use the `md` documents for larger ideas and the conceptual way forward.

* `helminthR` dev

* Meet with Abigail to discuss IDEAS electives (11:15am)

* Teach lab for 4 hours

* Review Oecologia manuscript (soon-ish)
