## What have I worked on?
 
* `spatExtinct`: documented code a bit better. Found one small bug. Alex is on running the code now. 
  
* `rangeShape`: looks like minor revisions, and really interesting point about the sloppy use of abundance. Very excited about this one!

* `normalNiche`: some data formatting. attempted to train models on VM on Windows machine. Crashed. Models running now on FARM cluster (must have fixed permissions issues, since now I can install R packages...which is nice/essential). 

* `centConserve`: thought of slight modification to approach. Laid code down, but can't run it here. Will wait until home computer opens up and then test it out. 








### Tonight 

* `riverCats`: river cats! river cats! river cats! (minor league baseball game)







## What should I be working on now? 

* `abundanceSDM`: are sims done yet?

* `centConserve`: can I get code running yet?

* `normalNiche`: model training (likely will take a couple of days)

* `emergence`: think about best approach to the problem (trait v. traitless)
