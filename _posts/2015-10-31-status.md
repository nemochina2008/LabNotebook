## What did I work on today?

* Graded student lab reports

* Some edits to `parasiteR` (soon to be called `helminthR`...unless I think of something less dumb)

* Helped Julie do ecosystem ecology

 


## What should I be working on after RCN madness

* `globalHelminth`: Needs some writing love. Most of the plots are already made. Now I just need to weave that narrative (i.e. the hard part). 

* `helminthR` stuff.
