## What have I worked on?

 
* `dispersalTrait`: Finished measurements last night. I made a few plots today, structured some text, and spent way too long thinking about this. It was pretty much the only thing I did today. 



  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `hostRange`: more responding to reviewers

* `priorityEffects1`: made some minor changes. Read through and polished text.
