## What have I worked on?

* `macroHelminth`:

* `hostRange`: incorporated Shan's comments on introduction

* `spatialProjects`: refined `dispersalTrait`. It's ready to go.

* `rangeLean`: SDM approach is a bit tenuous. Maybe just go with polynomial fit angle. Species trait approach could be interesting, but seems like an entirely different paper.



## What should I be working on now?

* `nodeProperties`

* `spatialProjects`: think about some more things with beetles
