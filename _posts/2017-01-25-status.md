## What have I worked on?
 
* `yubikey`: last night I set up two-factor authentication for Gmail and Github. Eventually will also set up for home computer log-in and password management. 


* `priorityEffects1`: sketched out some ideas and read some articles, but I think Alan and Brett want to refine the model. Pushing forward with the model as it stands seems a bit foolish given this. 

* `priorityEffects2`: re-ran knn approach but calculating distance between predictions and actual in both x and y space. 

* `appliedMath`: derivation of the wave equation and diving into PDEs

* `reading`: Mertz, _et al._ 1968. _Biometrics. Provides experimental evidence for predator satiation in cannibalistic interaction between adults and pupae, which is interesting since most models assume type I functional response. It'd be even more interesting if adults were able to preferentially cannablize eggs of competitors, but I don't imagine this is likely. 


* `checkerboard`: data entry and validation. Caught up and everything is looking good. Excited to see it in 5 weeks. 

* `beetleMeeting`: sketched out some points I'd like feedback on during tomorrow's meeting. 



### Tonight 

* `reading`: mainly about stochasticity in two-species models, some noise-color thinking, some extinction thinking. 


* `graphDissim`: check on initial experiments. If they finished running, scope the findings and see variation and distribution of metric. 


* ``:


  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `priorityEffects1` and `priorityEffects2`: use the morning meeting as a jumping off point on this.
