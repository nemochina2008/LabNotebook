## What have I worked on?

* `rangeShape`: data acquired. Pushed along nicely.

* `priorityEffects`: reading specifically for this project. Set up repo and maybe rough analysis pipeline.

* `networkEWS`: percolation based early warning signals use inferred functional networks that ignore spatial structure of populations, even though the spatial distribution of patches is 1) likely pretty important and 2) not discernable from time series correlations between patches ([Gilarranz, Hastings, and Bascompte 2015](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12080-014-0231-y)). Printed out some articles, and will be pushing these ideas along shortly.




## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: review article for _Ecology and Evolution_ while traveling for wedding, and provide friendly review of Alyssa's article

* `logistics`: unpack room, pack for wedding
