## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeShape`: more analysis for supplement, responding to reviewers. Scraper for BirdLife data. Text edits galore. 

  
* `graphDissim`: Tim is ready to submit. Minor polishing edits. Figshare code ready to go. 








### Tonight 

* `centConserve`: get that variance code running. Last time it had completed, my cat knocked the computer power cord. She is sentient and hates my work. 


* `rangeShape`: Scrape the BirdLife data, get other code running










## What should I be working on now? 

* `rangeShape`, `graphDissim`, `centConserve`, probably some other stuff.
