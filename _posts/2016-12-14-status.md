## What have I worked on?
 
* `hostRange`: made small change based on a comment Shan made. 

* `extinctionChapter`: finished metapop section rough version. Maybe solicit Colin's input and then adjust accordingly. 

* `networkEWS`: clarified some portions of the preliminary methods section. 

* `nodeProperties`: incorporated Barbara's edits. Shifted lots around in the discussion. 



### Tonight 

* `labLogistics`: solo dishwashing party! 


  
## What should I be working on now? 

 
* `priorityEffects`: do it.

* `networkEWS`: look at time series to get idea of population extinction and rescue.
