## What did I work on today?

* `hostRange`: instead of working on the `tempVar` stuff, I spent nearly the entire day working on an `RCN` project. It's shaping up pretty nicely though, and I'll share more details on that once the project develops a bit more.

* `zika`: some thinking, but not much doing. I just needed at least one other item in this list before I felt like I could call it a day.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `backpacking`: going to see some pretty parts of NC


## Next week

* `tempVar`: for real.

* `nicheClass` PCA loading plot, updates to manuscript text, PCA [stopping rule rabbit hole](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.594.7407&rep=rep1&type=pdf), etc.
