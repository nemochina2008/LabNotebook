## What have I worked on?
 
* `thresholdDensity`: polished version. Read aloud and fixed odd-sounding sentences. Polished response to reviewers and sent to collaborators. 

* `priorityEffects1`: checked all model code to make sure it wasn't a code-error that's been causing the fitting problems. Nope; code is solid...just nonfunctional. Need to sit and think why the model can't fit simulated data. 

* `zika`: provide comments on resubmission text and responses to reviewers

* `labLogistics`: sent emails to lab assistant candidates. 1-2 more undergrads will join the lab soon. Exciting times as experiments ramp up! :)

* `MogePS`: Provide comments on Moge's personal statement.








### Tonight 

* `arc`: getting a 3-month membership for treadmill and weights access until it gets warm enough outside to just run and do plyometrics.

* `helmSize`: push along ms text. 

* `popBuffering`: Make sure conceptual flow is in place with clear predictions and rationale. Plots are golden. Maybe clarify some small points in results. 





  
## What should I be working on now? 


* `checkerboard`: data entry and validation 

* `priorityEffects2`: calculate slopes of population trajectories in the multivariate space of initial abundance with information on generation as well. KNN it and compare slope as a function of generational difference and distance in phase space.
