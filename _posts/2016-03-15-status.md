## What did I work on today?

* `teach`

* `awardApps`: best student paper award applications ($$$$)

* `dissertation`: incorporated nitpicky changes from UGA admins about dissertation formatting. I can't imagine not using LaTex for this document (Table of Contents/Figures/Tables would be nightmarish!). Sent along author rights statements to Graduate School.

* `fishParasite`: wrote some code. Will run tonight, and then add a paragraph or so to the Supplement.

* `RCN`: update meeting. I got to sit in the sun. It was lovely.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `reading`: need to read before I can formulate good questions for `tempVar` population dynamics stuff.

* `tempVar`: sketch out protocols for data use. Talk to Reni to see if time series are good enough for her application.
