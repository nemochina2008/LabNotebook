## What have I worked on?

* `RCN`: recovery + emailed collaborators. `hostRange` and `nodeProperties` stable, `macroHelminth` needs some work.

* `labLogistics`: **how** did we burn through that much flour _that_ quickly? Literally just asked if we could order my weight in flour for the lab. Hopefully this level of consumption is some lagged indicator of the amount of science I'm doing.


* `rangeLean`: talked with Robin about model development, and identified the questions to test. Sent along some information on parameterization.



### Tonight

* `rangeShape`: need to run on a machine with decent memory. Beating up TRY data, and then doing final plotting and such. Will push this along tonight.


* `professionalService`: finish off review and send it in


## What should I be working on now?
