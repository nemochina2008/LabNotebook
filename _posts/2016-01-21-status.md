title: Status for January 21

## What did I work on today?

* `hostRange`: continue to push this along

* `thresholdDensity`: Plotted analytical solution, matches up well with stochastic simulations (as it should). Still searching in the parameter space for some agreement between stochastic and deterministic models with regards to the probability of pathogen invasion.

_Need to craft email to Marty explaining the current state of this project._

* `tempVar`: neonate farming. Made sure that the experiment should be able to start at the end of January.

* `helminthR`: paper accepted with a few minor changes. Made those changes. Wrote letter and responses to reviewers. Ready to send back in.

* `taught`: zooplankton and benthic worms



## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `thresholdDensity`: e-mail Marty an update on this work.
