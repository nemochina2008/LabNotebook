## What have I worked on?

* `nodeProperties`: ran models with smaller interaction depth and lower learning rate and got the same answer. Barbara suggested splitting family into a series of _n_ binary covariates.

* `priorityEffects`: detailed daily instructions for undergrad team, making sure there are no holes in this one.

* `reading`: eventually I should stop reading and start doing, but I'm good with reading for now.

* `beetleTeam`: Skype with Beetle team in the morning. Next Skype is on Monday, so take this time to come up with a couple of concrete questions and ideas for empirical tests to pitch to the team. Ideally, these would be smaller (< 100 patch) single-patch experiments. If I can run `dispersalTrait` alongside of `priorityEffects`, it'd be great, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

* `parasiteStuff`: conceptualized a few next steps for projects with Colin.




## What should I be working on now?

* `parasiteStuff`: Head to Berkeley to discuss some next steps with Colin (and to see Berkeley)

* [Run this trail](http://tuleyome.org/trails/fiske-creek-trail/) on Sunday.

 * `nodeProperties`: use this as a time to clean up code, and drop one of the evolutionary distinctiveness measures since they are nearly equivalent. Maybe remove grey points from figures as Charlie suggested?

 * `beetleTeam`: At next Skype call, make sure folks are onboard with experimental design of `dispersalTrait` and start grabbing the necessary supplies.
