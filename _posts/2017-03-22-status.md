## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeShape` and `flatEarth`: tweaks and formatting and prep for submission for both these manuscripts. 

* `alanLunch`: discussed interesting project. Did some reading to figure out what's been done in the realm. Could lead to nice theory project, with or without beetle accompaniment. 

* `reading`: other reading as well, including [this cool one](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12579/epdf)

* `helmSize`: some tweaks to text and discussion with Alyssa about some data stuff. 



### Tonight 

* `graphDissim`: methods. Wasn't able to get to it yesterday.

* `helmSize`: Need to dive into egg size non-linearities to see what's going on there, and scale figure 1 accordingly. 


  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `beetleMeeting`: tomorrow morning. Be ready to discuss `priorityEffects` and associated follow-ups, as well as `dispersalTrait` and `checkerBoard`.

* `priorityEffects2`: dev.



### Weekend projects 

* `centConserve`: weekend project. Push it along. 

* `hostRange`: edits to get closer to re-submission. Tap collaborators to get green light.
