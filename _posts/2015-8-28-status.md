## What did I work on today?

* Threshold host density work (never-ending!)

* Sent out a postdoc inquiry (which took half the day because I made countless tiny tiny tweaks to CV and website...as if _that's_ going to be the deciding factor)

* Read [this](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07478v1.pdf), and printed [this](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1813/20150927.abstract) to read later.

## What should I be working on over the weekend?

* Start piecing together dissertation concluding chapter. Intro is in halfway decent shape, but discussion is hardly touched.

* SRS project thinking + updating repo (meeting on Monday with brain trust)

* RCN `GlobalHelminth` work as it pertains to existing projects

* Get ready to talk to press office people about [fish parasite co-extinction paper](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13185).
