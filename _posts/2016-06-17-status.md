## What have I worked on?

* `srsMetacom`: a bit more data formatting.

* `hostRange`: pushed along, but have a couple of small conceptual concerns I'd like to discuss with coauthors before I proceed.

* `nodeProperties`: looks pretty solid apart from lack of firm discussion section. Email to collaborators with updated introduction and analysis this weekend(?)

* `professionalService`: reviewed an article. Really interesting manuscript.


## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: review second article.

* `srsMetacom`: push along analysis and think about how it should fit into the current manuscript. Since I'm space limited, much of the detail may get shunted to the supplement.
