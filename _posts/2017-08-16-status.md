## What have I worked on?
 
* `scramble`: protcol development. Discussed briefly with Alan. Set up git repo structure. This one will also have to wait until beetles have been on King Arthur for a bit. 
  
* `whiteBoard`: got my projects organized and such

* `helminthR`: updated documentation for submission to CRAN. Lines should be less than 80 characters long, and I hate everything.

* `checkerBoard`: read through and made minor text tweaks. 

* `jobs`: organized a couple of repos and made a README with application deadlines and which had been submitted. So far I've applied to 2 jobs. 

* `centConserve`: a bit of writing and finding the right direction. 


### Tonight


* `centConserve`: Kat'z centrality and variance modeling

* `normalNiche`: if time permits, start laying down some code.




## What should I be working on now? 


* `normalNiche`


* `beetleProjects`: check on code, and be ready to jump on simulations if it's finished. Demographic parameters for single species fits don't seem to be changing much, which is both good and bad. Good because it seems like we got it right the first time, bad because growth rates seem a bit high (nearing that Ricker limit-cycle/chaos territory)


* `jobApps`: I have 1 year of postdoc experience now. Am I competitive yet? The answer is likely no, but let's find out.
