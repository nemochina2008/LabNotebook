## What did I work on today?

* `thresholdDensity`: finished and ran homemade Gillespie simulator, keeping spore death deterministic, and allowing for stochastic spore death. The predicted R0 lines up with observed data for the deterministic model, but stochastic model is acting weird.

* `srsMetacom`: Chris will send his notes within the next couple of days. Then I'll incorporate his edits, sit and think on it, read it a bunch, and then edit it and send to the group.

* `twitterHole`: I fell into it and came out with a series of articles I now _need_ to read...including [1](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/11/26/032938), [2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/ele.12548/full), and [3](https://peerj.com/preprints/1589.pdf).

* `barrigaNetwork`: pushed this along. Data are organized. Should meet with Paola soon-ish to go over some of the preliminary analyses, and let that conversation find the overlap between our interests so we can develop a solid protocol.


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `thresholdDensity`: continue working on this

* `read`: Read all the articles you found while procrastinating, along with more _Chaos in Ecology_

* `barrigaNetwork`: Tidy up code and e-mail to Paola
