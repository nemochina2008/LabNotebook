## What have I worked on?
 
* `beetleLab`: undergrad researcher interviews

* `professionalService`: completed review

* `thresholdDensity`: still some minor tweaking. 

* `flatEarth`: small tweaks to text




### Tonight 

* `flatEarth`: get secondary models running

* `graphDissim`: think think think

* `centConserve`: push along




  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `rangeLean`: edits to text to make less "range shift-ey". Work in more macroecology.
