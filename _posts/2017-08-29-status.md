## What have I worked on?
 
* `abundanceSDM`: plotting of simulation results and adding of supplemental text. Need to re-run some of the simulations and some additional code. 

* `spatExtinct`: added more simulation code. Read through and bug check it, and then get it running on home machine tonight.

* `missingLinks2`: created 2 features. Plan to re-train model and then pass along data to Drew for variable importance. 

* `rOpenSciApp`: wrote some text for a working group application. 

* `HPnest`: some preliminary stuff running now. Will push along when time permits.





### Tonight

* `run`: too hot to run with group. Fartlek tonight. 5x (4 min hard, 4 min easy) on dirt. Add reps if legs allow. 

* get `abundanceSDM` and `spatExtinct` sims running (priority on `abundanceSDM`)

* `normalNiche`: push forward data cleaning and workflow

* `HPnest`: if time permits, get the spatial stuff running. 





## What should I be working on now? 

* `reading`: lots of stuff e.g., [1](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/693781), [2](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0065250416300575/1-s2.0-S0065250416300575-main.pdf?_tid=558a673e-8d18-11e7-9dad-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1504052311_c9c4dd4607445825989026c847a15c76), [3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.01714/epdf)

* `helminthR`: continue dev before tossing to CRAN

* `normalNiche`: set up data cleaning pipeline and start shoving data down it.
