## What have I worked on?
 
* `dispersalTrait`: seeing some dispersal. Plan to run it out for the full experimental duration, and then we can scope out the data and see if there is enough variation in dispersal distances to be useful. 

* `ESAabstract`: submitted and renewed membership. I miss that student membership price. 

* `priorityEffects2`: pushed along conceptually, but need the data to be entered and validated before I can proceed. Unsure how to address the elephant in this study though. May have to re-run it to make sure there wasn't something hinky. 







* `experimentIdeas`: `dispersalTrait` will be done in 10 days, `priorityEffects` another 5 weeks, and `checkerboard` isn't taking that much time. Sat down and sketched out loose protocols and ideas for spatial experiments



### Tonight 

* `scienceDinner`: Group dinner with Chris Fields, the Storer lecturer this week.
