## What did I work on today?

* `tempVar` organized repo. Pushed along extinction time and speed of extinction components.

* `nicheClass`: pushed along some of the plotting. Still not complete, but closing in on final plots. Need to focus on writing soon.

* `nodeProperties`: been awhile since I've talked about this project. The goal is to predict host centrality in networks of parasite sharing. It's an RCN project that includes myself, John Drake, Barbara Han, Patrick Stephens, and Andrew Park. Manuscript is written, but some polishing needs to occur before submission. I want this to be in good form for the upcoming RCN meeting. I worked on addressing some of Barbara's questions today, and making minor tweaks to manuscript text.


## What should I be working on tomorrow
