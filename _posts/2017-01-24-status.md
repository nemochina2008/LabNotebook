## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects1`: pushed along hard again. Chatted with Alan for a bit about the project and lab logistics. Two new plots. Single species model validation. Some manuscript skeleton dev.

* `popBuffering`: Alyssa is taking a look at it. May provide comments. 

* `checkerboard`: visually checked data for inconsistencies, but haven't entered or validated yet.





### Tonight 

* `arc`: legs feel good. Maybe 5-6 decently quick miles?

* `macroHelminth`: keep this one rolling. Clarify data section and spatial bias section. Think more about whether nestedness section should stay. It fits into macroecology based on Stephens _et al_ 2016, but it does seem like a bit of a departure from the other sections. 

* `graphDissim`: new project I'm letting bounce around in my head. Could be cool. Do some exploration tonight to see if there's anything worth saying here. 




## What should I be working on now? 

* `priorityEffects1`: keep pushing along

* `appliedMath`: class

* `priorityEffects2`: calculate divergence from KNN prediction in terms of both x and y space. 

* `checkerboard`: enter and validate
