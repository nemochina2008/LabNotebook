## What did I work on today?

* `thresholdDensity`: Parameter hunting, model running, manuscript updates.... all for naught if trying to use R0 as a threshold parameter (environmental transmission messes stuff up).

* `srsMetacom`: Edited manuscript text per Drew's suggestions. Intro, methods, and results in decent shape.

* Helped Michelle set up [her open lab notebook!](http://mvevans89.github.io/LabNotebook/). This means that 3/5 out of the Drake lab graduate students have open lab notebooks (see [Paige's here](http://paigemiller.github.io/LabNotebook/)).


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `birdMortality`: 11am Skype call to discuss data and questions. Need to look over data beforehand and think about limitations/opportunities.

* `macroHelminth`: set lower threshold for number of unique hosts and parasites present, and get moving on this. Once data are in correct format, analysis should go smoothly.

* `srsMetacom`: Discussion writing and tweaks to results

* ``
