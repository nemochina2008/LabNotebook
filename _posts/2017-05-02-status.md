## What have I worked on?
 
* `srsSuccession`: reminded myself that this project is neat, and pushed it along a little bit. Will pull Marcus, Drew, John, Chris, etc. in if it turns into anything more. 

* `microcosmReview`: added a paragraph and thought about manuscript structure. How many boxes is _too_ many?

* `flatEarth`: John's edits incorporated. Last read through. It's ready to submit (I think). 


* `KeesingTalk`: fun disease ecology time; keynote from Keesing and posters from bunch of folks. 




  
## What should I be working on now? 

* `flatEarth`: submit
