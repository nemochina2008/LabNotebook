## What did I work on today?

* `helminthR`: minor revisions. Good news, and a really helpful and positive review. Incorporated all changes suggested, and will re-submit within the next few days. Going to sit and think on it for a minute.

* `srsMetacom`:  made SRS map. It looks good, but took entirely too long!

* `threshold`: Pushed some idea along. Think I found something interesting, but could be garbage (`potential dissertation title`)


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `macroHelminth`: type some words good.
