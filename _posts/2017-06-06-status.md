## What have I worked on?
 

* `stochasticPopDynamics`: last class of the quarter. Learned a lot. Solid class. 

* `review`: finished off review (took a big chunk of today)
  
* `thresholdDensity`: polishing edits and passed back to John and Marty. 

* `nodeProperties`: small style edits. 

* `checkerBoard2`: worked on introduction, but writing was a struggle today.






### Tonight 

* `run`: 3 x (800x400x800) at 5k pace. Weird workout.

* `organizeThoughts`: Which projects (`side` and `hastings-lab`) deserve the most attention right now? 


## What should I be working on now? 

* `checkerBoard2`: continue working on the introduction
