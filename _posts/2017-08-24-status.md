## What have I worked on?
 
* `WOSfail`: pushed manuscript text along and started discussion of next steps with coauthors. 
  
* `reading`: [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.04330/abstract), [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12822/abstract), and some others

* `scramble`: protocol tweaks and printed out. organized protocols in lab and did some small `labLogistics`. Lifted a bunch of flour. Made and printed out data sheets. Ready to rock and roll. This starts next week. 

* `abundanceSDM`: minor text tweaks and grammar checks. Simulations to be added to supplement running now. 

* `jobApps`: submitted an application.

* `metacom`: updated code with bug fix and will submit to CRAN sometime soon. 


### Tonight

* `run`: 7-12 depending how I feel




## What should I be working on now? 


* `helminthR`: use `httr` package to make http requests and try to cut out some of the other dependencies. Wouldn't really cut much out though. I'd just be reinventing the `rvest` wheel a bit for some slightly better error handling. Maybe I'm just confused. 

* `emergence`: snag some data and start pushing this forward. 

* `missingLinks2`: pass variable importance code to Drew (perhaps package into a Docker container?) to run on high memory machine. 

* `read`: many projects are out of my hands. While this is the case, I'm going to read and think.
