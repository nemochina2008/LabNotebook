## What did I work on today?

* `fishParasite`: finalized edits and sent to John and Andrew for final approval.

* `nodeProperties`: pushed along and sent to collaborators for comments

* `thresholdDensity`: Simulated deterministic and stochastic model formulations for a number of initial parameter values, finding that the same model formulation results in very different invasion probability predictions depending on whether a deterministic or stochastic framework is used. Understandable, but frustrating. If both have the same $R_{0}$, since they're the same model, shouldn't they also predict similar thresholds and have similar dynamics? No. I guess that's too much to hope for.




## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `thresholdDensity`: make it all make sense

* `macroHelminth`
