## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: pushed along analysis and manuscript text. Need to sit down with Alan and Brett before I can make much more progress. 


* `extinctionChapter`: small edits, but nothing substantial by any means. Colin is currently working at it. Maybe think of small conceptual figure that ties sections together (population, metapopulation, species are nested organization levels and sections). 


* `nodeProperties`: read the manuscript out loud (great for identifying garbage sentences) and wrote cover letter. Sent a note to collaborators asking if they would make changes they think are necessary before I start the submission process. 


* `labLogistics`: got data sheets ready for the next two weeks. De-cluttered lab space a bit. Hoping we can stay on top of dishes and data entry. We're doing okay on dishes, and halfway decent on data entry (`priorityEffects` data entry is solid, `stockData` less so). 






 
## What should I be working on now? 

* `priorityEffects`: Identify where the confusion lies and sketch out the things I need to know before I continue writing. Also identify weak spots in analysis (like the dumb convergence issue) and highlight steps forward. Create repo for second project from this work as well. We're on generation 3 currently. 









### Break projects 

* `helmSize`: analysis and writing. Need to first get Alyssa's feedback on manuscript direction.

* `NHMpredict`: play around more with `q=` in `ckanr`. The 5000 line limit stinks, but it may be possible to query based on specific columns (at least through the sql option). 

* `networkEWS`: Won't be able to really dive much into it over break, but worth thinking about it conceptually, sketching out logical flow, and maybe laying down a bit of code and text. 

* `laselva`: play around with it, and see if there's anything you could easily contribute to (even if it's just test suite dev).
