## What did I work on today?

It was a long day of teaching and counting _Daphnia_ in tubes. It was not all that enjoyable. 


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `fishParasite`: plotting and writing.

* `srsMetacom`: final touches and polishing before send to John. Time to write not like garbage.

* `defensePres`: Should probably start piecing it together, right?!


## Soon

* `teach`: Grade exams
