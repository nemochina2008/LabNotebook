## What did I work on today?

* `nicheClass`: protocol looking decent. read two papers for class summaries.

* `taught`: good stuff.

* `tempVar`: running


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `thresholdDensity`: Read the manuscript, think about final plots, add stochastic model section, clean/annotate code better to place in supplement. This needs to be in committee's hands in a week.

* `georeference`: parasite extinction group. I have like < 200 more points and need to do it.
