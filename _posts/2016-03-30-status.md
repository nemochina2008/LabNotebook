## What did I work on today?

* `zika`: pushed along models. Will nudge Barbara soon to get on other model dev.

* `labProject`: frustrating.

* `nicheClass`: pushed code along solidly, but manuscript structure needs work.


## What should I be working on tomorrow


* `tempVar`: have a good idea about population buffering I'd like to create protocol for.
