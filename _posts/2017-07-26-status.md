## What have I worked on?
 
* `abundanceSDM`: added two plots and some more words. Developed methods, results, and discussion. I have no idea why I'm pushing this along so hard. Maybe it's because in 3 weeks, I'll be working on nothing but beetles for a long while. 


### Tonight

* `centConserve`: writing?



## What should I be working on now? 

* `abundanceSDM`: polish

* `centConserve`: writing

* `jobApps` and `reading`
