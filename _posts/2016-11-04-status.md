## What have I worked on?

* `labLogistics`: made sure all undergrad workers have access to Beetle drive (for data entry)

* `baskettLabMeeting`: practice presentations for WSN.

* `hastingsLabMeeting`: discussed Ch 2 of _Mathematics of Biological Invasions_. Me leading discussion of the chapter is like a kitten discussing how to hunt prey to a bunch of lions.

* `macroHelminth`: initial attempts at accounting for sampling bias in plots. Needs writing in text in support. I hate to dwell on sampling bias, because it makes it seem like the data aren't of good quality. I have an idea of how to show that these data are legit.


### Motivational quote

## What should I be working on now?

* `priorityEffects`: pmf reading and thinking and crying and doing(?)

* `macroHelminth`: write some text to go along with the new figures

* `labDishes`: not glamorous, but need to get done.
