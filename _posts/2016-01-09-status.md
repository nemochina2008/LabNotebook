## What did I work on today?

* `georeference`: Did it for 4 hours. Woof.

* `DaphniaMonsters`: washed tanks and did some stock maintenance to keep the Daphnia healthy and happy ... for now **evil laugh**

* `read`: [Taylor's law](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02033.pdf), [Noble et al. 2015](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150408/ncomms7664/full/ncomms7664.html), and [this paper (again)](http://www.eve.ucdavis.edu/sschreiber/reprints/amnat-15b.pdf), along with finishing up _Chaos in Ecology_
