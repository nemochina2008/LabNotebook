## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: running RickerMix code on the FARM cluster. 

* `sizeDistro`: patches created (had to balance the cluster computing with some scooping flours in plastic boxes)

* `networkEWS`: looked at old code. Something is here, but this may get backburnered.

* `rangeShape`: prepare for submission (cover letter written, reviewers suggested).

* `checkerboard`: EDA. Laid down some code to format and beat up the experimental data. Looking good. 




### Tonight

* `run`: Putah creek area. Maybe explore some more farm fields. 

  
## What should I be working on now? 


* any of the following side projects `graphDissim`,  `helmSize`, `macroHelminth`,  `centConserve`, `hostUtility`, `srsDistDecay`
