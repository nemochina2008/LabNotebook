## What did I work on today?

* `nodeProperties`: Pushed along. Tossed to collaborators for input.

* Graded papers (graphing exercise)

* `insectDisease`: need to just knock the descriptive part out, then maybe brainstorm how these data can be used. 

* `globalHelminth`: Needs some writing love. Most of the plots are already made. Now I just need to weave that narrative (i.e. the hard part). 



## What should I be working on tomorrow

*
