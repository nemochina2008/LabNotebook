## What have I worked on?
 


* `beetleLogistics`: some dishes and organizing. Dragging 120 lbs of flour from first floor. I'm a scientist.

* `checkerBoard1`: fixed bug in simulations and am currently re-running some parts. Should be done by tomorrow. 

* `teary`: discussed speakers to invite. Some solid names that I'm hoping will visit Davis. 

* `jiaProposal`: Provided comments on undergrad research proposal of Jia, a beetle lab researcher.

* `priorityEffects`: tested to see if likelihood of sim parameters was minimized by NLL function of the model used to generate data. It was not. WTH? Investigating further tonight.





### Tonight 

* `priorityEffects`: NLL and simulation functions; check for bugs. Fit single species models to simulated data from two-species model with one species at 0 initial abundance. 

* `graphDissim`: manuscript dev. Small-ish tweaks for clarity. 

* `checkerBoard1`: methods dev to accommodate simulation results



## What should I be working on now? 

* `popBuffering`: figure out how to respond to "little r" concern.

* `dispersalTrait`: tweaks to manuscript

* `hostRange` and `nodeProperties`: check with collaborators on both these projects.
