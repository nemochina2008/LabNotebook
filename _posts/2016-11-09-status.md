## What have I worked on?

* `priorityEffects`: Entered and validated all gen 0 and gen 1 data. Created script to automate conversion of xls* to csv, place these files in a central location, and mash it all into R. Data are versioned currently sepaprately from analysis and manuscript workflow. Made a couple of initial heatmaps to show Alan.

* `rangeLean`: read through Robin's C++ code to get an understanding of what's going on. Figured out source of the gcc/g++ compiler error. This will be fixed in the most current iteration, and we can go from there.

* `nodeProperties`: addressed some of Patrick's comments. Small tweaks to text. Needs to be re-run with updated GMPD data, but I'm still waiting on that.

* `reading`: read a couple metapopulation articles.

## What should I be working on now?

* `alanMeeting`: I'm lecturing in his class next week, so we're going to go over what I'll be learning this weekend. Also going to discuss some of the `priorityEffects` stuff, and other nascent/ongoing lab projects.

* `priorityEffects`: keep pushing along data visualization. Hopefully Alan will provide insight into the modeling aspect. Do I write pmfs for each species and optimize for each species? He seemed to indicate earlier that dynamics of both species would be fit simulataneously. I'm pretty confused.

* `extinctionChapter`: if time permits, push some of the post-Levin's text along.
