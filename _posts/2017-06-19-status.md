## What have I worked on?
 
* `flatEarth` and `thresholdDensity`: read-through and tiny tweaks. Both passed to John for comments 
  

* `stockData`: came in and validated buckets and buckets of stock data on Friday night. We're caught up now!


* `graphDissim`: added paragraph to discussion and updated the methods section


* `nodeProperties`: polished. 


* `flourTest`: hopefully starting today if we have enough beetles. If not, it'll have to wait another 2-3 weeks for last bit of `priorityEffects` to finish. 






### Tonight


* `graphDissim`: run the stats and format tables. Also prepare code for submission. 


* `nodeProperties`: polish code and upload to figshare prior to submitting manuscript





## What should I be working on now? 


* `centConserve`, `srsSuccession`, `rangeShape`, `theoryQuestions`, `emergence`,
