## My open lab notebook

Hello! I'm Tad, a postdoc in Alan Hastings lab at University of California @ Davis. For information about my science, check out my [website](http://taddallas.github.io). This lab notebook is mean to be a storehouse for project notes as I push projects forward. The goal is two-fold; _1)_ to hold myself accountable for day-to-day tasks and project status and _2)_ to communicate to others what I'm working on, hopefully in enough detail to be able to follow, and with appropriate links to Github repos containing project files.

This blog was created on the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) platform, templating from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com),and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/taddallas).

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to contact me, or report an issue on Github.

Thanks for reading!
